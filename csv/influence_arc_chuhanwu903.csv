Thus, an effective pooling method Among existing pooling methods, average pooling is a representative one which takes the average of the L1 norm of input features (Tang et al., 2014, 2015a,b). However, average pooling equally regards the input representation vector at each position and ignores their different informativeness for learning text representation, which may not be optimal (Johnson and Zhang, 2015). Thus, other pooling methods such as max pooling (Collobert et al., 2011; Kim, 2014) and attentive pooling (Yang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b) are widely used in neural NLP models.

Pooling is usually an essential step in these methods to build contextual representations by summarizing the information of input features (LeCun et al., 2015). The simplest pooling method is average pooling, which is used in many approaches to construct text representations (Tang et al., 2014, 2015a,b). For example, Tang et al. (2015a) proposed to apply average pooling to the output of CNN filters to capture global contexts in a sentence. In addition, they also proposed to average the sentence representations learned by parallel CNN networks with different window sizes. In their another work (Tang et al., 2015b), they proposed to apply average pooling to the sequence of sentence representations to build the representations of an entire document.

Massive news articles are generated and posted online every day, making it difficult for users to find interested news quickly (Okura et al., 2017). Personalized news recommendation can help users alleviate information overload and improve news reading experience (Wu et al., 2019b). Thus, it is widely used in many online news platforms (Li et al., 2011; Okura et al., 2017; An et al., 2019). In traditional recommender systems, users and items are usually represented using IDs, and their interactions such as rating scores are used to learn ID representations via methods like collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008). However, news recommendation has some special challenges. First, news articles on news websites update very quickly. New news articles are posted continuously, and existing news articles will expire in short time (Das et al., 2007). Thus, the cold-start problem is very severe in news recommendation. Second, news articles contain rich textual information such as title and"

It shows that selecting important words in news texts using attention can help learn more informative news representations. Another interesting finding is that the combination of LSTM and attention can achieve the best performance. However, to our best knowledge, it is not used in existing news recommendation methods. 5.3.2 Pre-trained Language Models Next, we explore whether the quality of news representation can be further improved by the pretrained language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which have achieved huge success in different NLP tasks. We applied BERT to the news representation module of three state-of-theart news recommendation methods, i.e., NAML, LSTUR and NRMS. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. We find that by replacing the original word embedding module with the pre-trained BERT model, the performance of different news recommendation methods can be improved. It shows the BERT model pre-trained on large-scale corpus like Wikipedia can provide useful semantic information for news representation. We also find that fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model with the"

Since most of these news recommendation methods are based on news titles, for fair comparison, we only used news titles in experiments unless otherwise mentioned. We will explore the usefulness of different news texts such as body in Section 5.3.3. In order to simulate the practical news recommendation scenario where we always have unseen users not included in training data, we randomly sampled half of the users for training, and used all the users for test. For those methods that need word embeddings, we used the Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) as initialization. Adam was used as the optimizer. Since the non-clicked news are usually much more than the clicked news in each impression log, following (Wu et al., 2019b) we applied negative sampling technique to model training. All hyper-parameters were selected according to the results on the validation set. The metrics used in our experiments are AUC, MRR, nDCG@5 and nDCG@10, which are standard metrics for recommendation result evaluation.

It is not appropriate to simply representing them using IDs, and it is important to understand their content from their texts (Kompan and Bielikov´a, 2010). Third, there is no explicit rating of news articles posted by users on news platforms. Thus, in news recommendation users’ interest in news is usually inferred from their click behaviors in an implicit way (Ilievski and Roy, 2013). A large-scale and high-quality dataset can significantly facilitate the research in an area, such as ImageNet for image classification (Deng et al., 2009) and SQuAD for machine reading comprehension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). There are several public datasets for traditional recommendation tasks, such as Amazon dataset1 for product recommendation and MovieLens dataset2 for movie recommendation. Based on these datasets, many well-known recommendation methods have been developed. However, existing studies on news recommendation are much fewer, and many of them are conducted on proprietary datasets (Okura et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019a). Although there are a few public datasets for news recommendation, they are usually in small size and most of them are not in English. Thus, a public 1 2 http://jm"

We denote the hidden representation sequences of words in title and body as Et = [et1 , et2 , ..., etN ] and Eb = [eb1 , eb2 , ..., ebP ], respectively. Different words in a title or body may have different importance for modeling the content. For instance, the word “MUST” in Fig. 1 is more important than the word “About” in learning title representation for clickbait detection. Thus, we apply attention mechanisms (Yang et al., 2016) to select words in the title and body to form unified representations for them (denoted as et and eb ), which are respectively formulated as follows: 3.2 et = Attention([et1 , et2 , ..., etN ]), (1) eb = Attention([eb1 , eb2 , ..., ebP ]).

Extensive experiments on the CoNLL-2003 benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach in exploiting entity dictionaries to improve the performance of various NER models. CC L Named entity recognition (NER) aims to extract entity names from texts and classify them into several pre-defined categories, such as person, location and organization (Levow, 2006). It is an important task in natural language processing, and a prerequisite for many downstream applications such as entity linking (Derczynski et al., 2015) and relation extraction (Lin et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). Thus, NER is a hot research topic. In this paper, we focus on the English NER task. Many methods have been proposed for English NER, and most of them model this task as a word-level sequence labeling problem (Chiu and Nichols, 2016). For example, Ma and Hovy (2016) proposed a CNN-LSTM-CRF model for English NER. They used CNN to learn word representations from characters, LSTM to model the contexts of words, and CRF to decode labels.

Thus, the inference speed of the student model is approximately K times faster than the teacher. We first use the teacher and student models to separately process the input news text (denoted as x) through their Transformer layers and obtain the hidden representation of each token. We use a shared attentive pooling (Yang et al., 2016) layer (with parameter set Θp ) to convert the hidden representation sequences output by the teacher and student models into unified news embeddings, and finally use a shared dense layer (with parameter set Θd ) to predict the classification probability scores based on the news embedding.

In recent years, several deep learning based methods proposed to learn user and item representations from original review texts (Zhang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017; Catherine and Cohen, 2017; Seo et al., 2017b,a; Chen et al., 2018; Tay et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019).

Denote a news title with M words as [w1 , w2 , ..., wM ]. Through this layer it is converted into a vector sequence [e1 , e2 , ..., eM ]. The second layer is a word-level multi-head self-attention network (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018). The interactions between words are important for learning news representations. For example, in the news title “Rockets Ends 2018 with a Win”, the interaction between “Rockets” and “Win” is useful for understanding this news, and such long-distance interactions usually cannot be captured by CNN. In addition, a word may interact with multiple words in the same news. For instance, in above example the word “Rockets” has interactions with both “Ends” and “Win”.

It consists of three major modules, i.e., news encoder, user encoder and click predictor. News Encoder. The news encoder module is used to learn representations of news from their titles. It contains three layers. The first one is word embedding, which converts a news title from a word sequence into a vector sequence. Denote a news title as [w1 , w2 , ..., wM ], where M is title length. It is converted into word vector sequence [e1 , e2 , ..., eM ] via a word embedding matrix. The second layer is a CNN network (Kim, 2014). Local contexts are important for understanding news titles. For example, in the news title “90th Birthday of Mickey mouse”, the local contexts of “mouse” such as “Mickey” is useful for inferring it is a comic character name.

Their method can significantly improve the classification performance without heavy feature engineering. However, existing methods are aimed to detect irony in tweets with explicit irony related hashtags. For example, tweets with #irony or #sarcasm hashtags are very likely to be ironic.

Identifying the ironic texts can help to understand the social web better and has many applications such as sentiment analysis (Ghosh and Veale, 2016). Irony detecting techniques are important to improve the performance of sentiment analysis. For example, the tweet “Monday mornings are my fave:)# not” is an irony with negative sentiment, but it will be probably classified as a positive one by a standard sentiment analysis model (Van Hee et al., 2016b). Thus, capturing the ironic information in texts is useful to predict sentiment more accurately (Van Hee et al., 2016a). However, determining whether a text is ironic is a challenging task since the the differences between ironic and non-ironic texts are usually subtle. For example, the tweet"

The intensity can be analysis in multiple categories (i.e. low, moderate and high) or real-valued. Identifying the intensity information of sentiment has potential to applications such as electronic business, social computing and public health (Wilson, 2008).

There have been different approaches based on corpus statistics (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Mihalcea et al., 2006) and ontology (Seco et al., 2004; S´anchez et al., 2012). After an effective word representation proposed by mikolov et al (2013), word similarity can be evaluated based on word embedding weights (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). Usually higher cosine similarity of word embedding vectors indicates higher semantic similarity. However, existing semantic methods are not capable of discriminating similar words between each other without additional information.

Word Embedding Since there are several out-of-vocabulary words in the dataset when using single pre-trained word embedding, we use three different embedding models to cover them.

Toponym resolution is usually modelled as a two-step task. The first step is toponym detection, which is a typical named entity recognition (NER) task. The second step is toponym disambiguation, which aims to map locations to its coordinates in the real world. NER is a widely explored task and most NER methods can be applied to toponym detection. For example, Ratinov and Roth (2009) used n-grams, history predictions as the input features of conditional random fields (CRF) for toponym detection.

Otherwise, we will select the toponym with the most population as output. 3 Experiment 3.1 3.2 Experimental Settings We conduct experiments on science reports provided the SemEval-2019 task 12. The data set is composed of 72 full-text journal articles in open access. There are four different metrics to evaluate the prediction performance, i.e., strict macro F1, strict micro F1, overlap macro F1 and overlap micro F1. In the toponym detection task, we used NLTK1 for sentence segmentation, word tokenization and POS tagging. We used ELMo(Reimers and Gurevych, 2017) and BERT(Devlin et al., 2018) model to generate 1024-dimensional contextualized word embeddings. We used GeoNames2 1 2 https://www.nltk.org http://www.geonames.org to construct lexical feature. The BIO tagging scheme(Sang and Veenstra, 1999) was used in the toponym detection task. In the toponym disambiguation task, we use GeoNames database to retrieve candidate toponyms. In our approach, the three word embedding vectors we used (Glove(Pennington et al., 2014), word2vec(Mikolov et al., 2013), fasttext(Bojanowski et al., 2017)) were all 300dimensional.

We follow the approach proposed by Klebanov et al. (2016) to use the lemmatizing strategy. The first module in our model is a lemmatizer. This module is used to lemmatize the verbs in texts via a dictionary. The input is a text with a sequence of word, and output is the text with lemmatized words. Since verbs with different forms can share the same lemmas, using the lemmatized verbs in texts can simplify the semantic information and reduce the number of out-of-vocabulary words.

Lexiconbased methods are free from data annotation, but they are unable to detect novel metaphorical usages and capture the contextual information. Supervised methods such as logistic regression classifier (Klebanov et al., 2014) can capture richer metaphor information. However, they need sophisticated hand-crafted features. To improve the collective techniques on detecting metaphors, the metaphor shared task1 aims to detect both metaphorical verbs and metaphors with other POS. Given a sentence and their words with specific POS tags, systems are required to determine whether each word is a metaphor. We propose a CNN-LSTM model with CRF or weighted softmax classifier to address this task. Our model can take advantage of both long-range and local information by utilizing both LSTM and CNN layers.

Recent research focus their attention on online public sources such as tweets due to their availability and authenticity (Onishi et al., 2018; Adrover et al., 2015; Salath´e and Khandelwal, 2011). The SMM4H shared task is proposed (Weissenbacher et al., 2019) to enhance ADR recognition. Task 1 is a binary classification task between ADR mentioned tweets and drug name only tweets, followed by task 2 to extract the particular position of ADR entities. Based on the work we did last year (Wu et al., 2018), we extend our previous model with hierarchical tweet representation and multi-head self-attention (HTR-MSA) to a model using both hierarchical tweet representation and attention (HTA) to jointly participate both tasks.
