Built on the principle of a fixed phrase translator, the application implements different natural language processing (NLP) technologies, such as speech recognition, neural machine translation and text-to-speech to improve usability. Its design allows easy portability to new domains and integration of different types of output for multiple target audiences. Even though BabelDr is far from solving the problem of miscommunication between patients and doctors, it is a clear example of NLP in a real world application designed to help minority groups to communicate in a medical context. It also gives some insights into the relevant criteria for the development of such an application."

Different studies show that automatic speech recognition systems have the potential to increase the productivity of the translation process as well as the quality. In this talk, we will explore the possibilities of using speech in the translation process by conducting a post-editing experiment with three professional translators in an international organization. Our experiment consisted of comparing three translation methods: speaking the translation with MT as an inspiration (RESpeaking), post-editing the MT suggestions by typing (PE), and editing the MT suggestion using speech (SPE). BLEU and HTER scores were used to compare the three methods. Our study shows that translators did more edits under condition RES, whereas in SPE, the resulting translations were closer to the reference according to the BLEU score and required less edits. Time taken to translate was the least in SPE followed by PE, RES methods and the translators preferred using speech to typing.These results show the potential of speech when it is coupled with post-editing.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study conducted on using post-editing and speech together in large scale international organizations."

In this work, we evaluate four different approaches to translate ellipsis in medical dialogues in the context of the speech to speech translation system BabelDr. We also investigate the impact of training data, using an under-sampling method and data with elliptical utterances in context. Results show that the best model is able to translate 88{\%} of elliptical utterances."

We focus on the point of view of professional translators and investigate how they perceive the differences between the MT output and a human reference (namely deletions, substitutions, insertions and word order). Our findings show that translators more frequently consider these differences to be errors in SMT than NMT, and that deletions are the most serious errors in both architectures. We also observe lower agreement on differences to be corrected in NMT than in SMT, suggesting that errors are easier to identify in SMT. These findings confirm the ability of NMT to produce correct paraphrases, which could also explain why BLEU is often considered as an inadequate metric to evaluate the performance of NMT systems."

The main aim of this survey was to identify how feasible it is to implement new post-editing workflows in an international organization using speech as an input method to edit inaccurate machine translation outputs. Overall, the results suggest that the surveyed translators do not hold a negative view on the use of ASR as part of their translation workflow, which provides a promising first step towards investigating the integration of speech based post-editing to translation workflows for productivity and ergonomic gains."

The platform is designed to make the component technologies readily accessible to sign language experts who are not necessarily computer scientists. Translation grammars are written in a version of Synchronous Context-Free Grammar adapted to the peculiarities of sign language. All processing is carried out on a remote server, with content uploaded and accessed through a web interface. Initial experiences show that simple translation grammars can be implemented on a time-scale of a few hours to a few days and produce signed output readily comprehensible to Deaf informants. Overall, the platform drastically lowers the barrier to entry for researchers interested in building applications that generate high-quality signed language."

Similarly, most web accessibility evaluation tools just provide users with an automated functionality to check the presence of text alternatives within the element, rather than a platform to verify their content. This paper presents an overview of the findings from an exploratory study carried out to investigate if the appropriateness level of text alternatives for images in French can be improved when applying controlled language (CL) rules. Results gathered suggest that using accessibility-oriented alt style rules can have a significant impact on text alternativesÂ appropriateness. Although more data would be needed to draw further conclusions about our proposal, this preliminary study already offers an interest insight into the potential use of CL checkers such as Acrolinx for language-based web accessibility evaluation."

In this paper, we present the evaluation experiments carried out to assess the impact of the proposed pre-editing rules on translation quality.

Within this context, we have developed automatic monolingual post-editing rules for French, aimed at correcting frequent errors automatically. The rules were developed using the AcrolinxIQ technology, which relies on shallow linguistic analysis. In this paper, we present an evaluation of these rules, considering their impact on the readability of MT output and their usefulness for subsequent manual post-editing. Results show that the readability of a high proportion of the data is indeed improved when automatic post-editing rules are applied. Their usefulness is confirmed by the fact that a large share of the edits brought about by the rules are in fact kept by human post-editors. Moreover, results reveal that edits which improve readability are not necessarily the same as those preserved by post-editors in the final output, hence the importance of considering both readability and post-editing effort in the evaluation of post-editing strategies."

The central question we investigate is whether the response is appropriate; we do this by extracting pairs of utterances where both members of the pair are responses by the same student to the same prompt, and where one response is accepted and one rejected. When the two spoken responses are presented in random order, native speakers show a reasonable degree of agreement in judging that the accepted utterance is better than the rejected one. We discuss the significance of the results and also present a small study supporting the claim that native speakers are nearly always recognised by the system, while non-native speakers are rejected a significant proportion of the time."

We consider methods for defining surface transformations that map common informal language constructions into their formal language counterparts, or vice versa; we then describe two ways to use these mappings, either to create artificial training data or to pre-process source text at run-time. An initial evaluation performed using crowd-sourced comparisons of alternate translations produced by a French-to-English SMT system suggests that both methods can improve performance, with run-time pre-processing being the more effective of the two."

However, even if an application perfectly recognizes the input, its understanding may be far from what the user originally meant. The user should be informed about what the system actually understood so that an error will not have a negative impact in the later stages of the dialogue. One important aspect that this work tries to address is the effect of presenting the systemÂs understanding during interaction with users. We argue that for specific kinds of applications itÂs important to confirm the understanding of the system before obtaining the output. In this way the user can avoid misconceptions and problems occurring in the dialogue flow and he can enhance his confidence in the system. Nevertheless this has an impact on the interaction, as the mental workload increases, and the userÂs behavior may adapt to the systemÂs coverage. We focus on two applications that implement the notion of rephrasing userÂs input in a different way. Our study took place among 14 subjects that used both systems on a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet."

First, we argue that the grammar-based recognition architecture offered by Regulus is more suitable for this type of application; second, that it is preferable to prompt the student in a language-neutral form, rather than in the L1; and third, that we can profitably record successful interactions by native speakers and store them to be reused as online help for students. The current system, which will be demoed at the conference, supports four L2s (English, French, Japanese and Swedish) and two L1s (English and French).

A particularly important practical example is medical speech translation. We report the results of experiments where we configured the various grammars and rule-sets in an Open Source medium-vocabulary multi-lingual medical speech translation system to generate large aligned bilingual corpora for English xe2x86x92 French and English xe2x86x92 Japanese, which were then used to train SMT models based on the common combination of Giza, Moses and SRILM. The resulting SMTs were unable fully to reproduce the performance of the RBMT, with performance topping out, even for English xe2x86x92 French, with less than 70% of the SMT translations of previously unseen sentences agreeing with RBMT translations. When the outputs of the two systems differed, human judges reported the SMT result as frequently being worse than the RBMT result, and hardly ever better; moreover, the added robustness of the SMT only yielded a small improvement in recall, with a large penalty in precision."

H05-2014,{J}apanese Speech Understanding using Grammar Specialization,2005,6,5,3,0,11421,manny rayner,Proceedings of {HLT}/{EMNLP} 2005 Interactive Demonstrations,0,"The most common speech understanding architecture for spoken dialogue systems is a combination of speech recognition based on a class N-gram language model, and robust parsing. For many types of applications, however, grammar-based recognition can offer concrete advantages. Training a good class N-gram language model requires substantial quantities of corpus data, which is generally not available at the start of a new project. Head-to-head comparisons of class N-gram/robust and grammar-based systems also suggest that users who are familiar with system coverage get better results from grammar-based architectures (Knight et al., 2001). As a consequence, deployed spoken dialogue systems for real-world applications frequently use grammar-based methods. This is particularly the case for speech translation systems. Although leading research systems like Verbmobil and NE-SPOLE! (Wahlster, 2000; Lavie et al., 2001) usually employ complex architectures combining statistical and rule-based methods, successful practical examples like Phraselator and S-MINDS (Phraselator, 2005; Sehda, 2005) are typically phrasal translators with grammar-based recognizers."

In MedSLT, the system uses a grammar-based recogniser that provides more predictable results to the translation component. The help module aims at addressing the lack of robustness inherent in this type of approach. It takes as input the result of a robust statistical recogniser that performs better for out-of-coverage data and produces a list of in-coverage example sentences. These examples are selected from a defined list using a heuristic that prioritises sentences maximising the number of N-grams shared with those extracted from the recognition result."

By exploiting the specific nature of the task, we show that it is possible to implement a solution which only slightly extends the representational complexity of the semantic representation language, by permitting an optional single nested level representing a subordinate clause construct. We sketch our solutions to the key problems of producing minimally nested representations using phrase-spotting methods, and writing cleanly structured rule-sets that map temporal and phrasal representations into a canonical interlingual form."

Despite using a very small training set for both the GLM and the SLM, the SLM delivers much better word error rates on unseen test material. Nonetheless, evaluating both systems on translation performance rather than word error rates, the GLM-based version of the system outperforms the SLM on the actual translation task."

The qualia noun-verb pair extraction is thus performed by applying the learnt rules on a part-of-speech or semantically tagged text. Stress is put on the quality of the learning when compared with traditional statistical or syntactical-based approaches. The linguistic relevance of the rules is also evaluated through a comparison with manually acquired qualia patterns."

In one of the components of this lexical model, called the qualia structure, words are described in terms of semantic roles. For example, the telic role indicates the purpose or function of an item (cut for knife), the agentive role its creation mode (build for house), etc. The qualia structure of a noun is mainly made up of verbal associations, encoding relational information. The Inductive Logic Programming learning method that we have developed enables us to automatically extract from a corpus N-V pairs whose elements are linked by one of the semantic relations defined in the qualia structure in GL, and to distinguish them, in terms of surrounding categorial context from N-V pairs also present in sentences of the corpus but not relevant. This method has been theoretically and empirically validated, on a technical corpus. The N-V pairs that have been extracted will further be used in information retrieval applications for index expansion."

We take the approach of Generative Lexicon Theory (GLT) (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1994c) which provides a system involving four levels of representation connected by a set of generative devices accounting for a compositional interpretation of words in context. We are interested in showing that we can reduce the set of collocations listed in the lexicon by introducing the notion of semantic collocations which can be predicted within GLT framework. We argue that the lack of semantic well-defined calculi in previous approaches, whether linguistic or conceptual, renders them unable to account for semantic collocations."

Avalanche bulletins deal with a limited semantic domain and employ a sublanguage in which nominal compounds occur frequently. These and other properties of the texts affect the treatment of compounds, permitting certain simplifications, while leaving a number of possible alternative analyses.We discuss the different problems involving the translation of compounds between German and French, and show how the computational environment in use permits two different approaches to the problem: an interlingua-based approach and a transfer-based approach.
