In recent years, the popularity of Kiezdeutsch has increased among young people, independently of their socio-economic origin, and has spread in social media, too. While previous studies have extensively investigated this language variety from a linguistic and qualitative perspective, not much has been done from a quantitative point of view. We perform the first large-scale data-driven analysis of the lexical and morpho-syntactic properties of Kiezdeutsch in comparison with standard German. At the level of results, we confirm predictions of previous qualitative analyses and integrate them with further observations on specific linguistic phenomena such as slang and self-centered speaker attitude. At the methodological level, we provide logistic regression as a framework to perform bottom-up feature selection in order to quantify differences across language varieties."

Our prediction experiments complement insights from classification using (a) manually designed features to characterise termhood and compound formation and (b) compound and constituent word embeddings. We find that for a broad binary distinction into {`}easy{'} vs. {`}difficult{'} general-language compound frequency is sufficient, but for a more fine-grained four-class distinction it is crucial to include contrastive termhood features and compound and constituent features."

This study presents the creation, the final dataset with ratings from 20 annotators and statistics over the dataset, to provide insight into the perception of domain-specific term difficulty. It is particularly striking that annotators agree on a coarse, binary distinction between easy vs. difficult domain-specific compounds but that a more fine grained distinction of difficulty is not meaningful. We finally discuss the challenges of an annotation for difficulty, which includes both the task description as well as the selection of the data basis."

We present a model based on Graph Attention Networks that captures this observation. It dynamically explores the social graph of a user, computes a user representation given the most relevant connections for a target task, and combines it with linguistic information to make a prediction.

Our model takes as input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and to (2) predict sentiment.

In this paper, we contribute to this situation by comparing several models on six different benchmarks, which belong to different domains and additionally have different levels of granularity (binary, 3-class, 4-class and 5-class). We show that Bi-LSTMs perform well across datasets and that both LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs are particularly good at fine-grained sentiment tasks (\textit{i.e.}, with more than two classes).

A discriminative classifier can overcome these problems, in particular when enriching standard lexical features with features geared towards verbal inflection."

In this work, we improve a two-dimensional multimodal version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Andrews et al., 2009) in various ways. (1) We outperform text-only models in two different evaluations, and demonstrate that low-level visual features are directly compatible with the existing model. (2) We present a novel way to integrate visual features into the LDA model using unsupervised clusters of images. The clusters are directly interpretable and improve on our evaluation tasks. (3) We provide two novel ways to extend the bimodal models to support three or more modalities. We find that the three-, four-, and five-dimensional models significantly outperform models using only one or two modalities, and that nontextual modalities each provide separate, disjoint knowledge that cannot be forced into a shared, latent structure."

Based on a thorough analysis of the particle verbs from a theoretical point of view, we identified empirical features and performed an automatic semantic classification. A focus of the study was on the mutual profit of theoretical and empirical perspectives with respect to salient semantic properties of the an particle verbs: (a) how can we transform the theoretical insights into empirical, corpus-based features, (b) to what extent can we replicate the theoretical classification by a machine learning approach, and (c) can the computational analysis in turn deepen our insights to the semantic properties of the particle verbs? The best classification result of 70{\%} correct class assignments was reached through a GermaNet-based generalization of direct object nouns plus a prepositional phrase feature. These particle verb features in combination with a detailed analysis of the results at the same time confirmed and enlarged our knowledge about salient properties."

The current study describes the collection process and a part-of-speech analysis of the association resource. In addition, we demonstrate that the associations provide insight into the semantic properties of the compounds, and perform a case study that predicts the degree of compositionality of the experiment compound nouns, as relying on the norms. Applying a comparatively simple measure of association overlap, we reach a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of rs=0.5228; p{\textless}000001, when comparing our predictions with human judgements."

The aim is to distinguish and characterize broad classes, such as qualitative (gran xe2x80x98bigxe2x80x99) and relational (pulmonar xe2x80x98pulmonaryxe2x80x99) adjectives, as well as to identify polysemous adjectives such as economic (xe2x80x98economic xe2x88xa3 cheapxe2x80x99). We specifically aim at modeling regular polysemy, that is, types of sense alternations that are shared across lemmata. To date, both semantic classes for adjectives and regular polysemy have only been sparsely addressed in empirical computational linguistics.Two main specific questions are tackled in this article. First, what is an adequate broad semantic classification for adjectives? We provide empirical support for the qualitative and relational classes as defined in theoretical work, and uncover one type of adjective that has not received enough attention, namely, the event-related class.

A lot of attention has consequently been paid to the development of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms for knowledge extraction. However, the nature of the input that humans are exposed to while learning commonsense knowledge has received much less attention. The BabyExp project is collecting very dense audio and video recordings of the first 3 years of life of a baby. The corpus constructed in this way will be transcribed with automated techniques and made available to the research community. Moreover, techniques to extract commonsense conceptual knowledge incrementally from these multimodal data are also being explored within the project. The current paper describes BabyExp in general, and presents pilot studies on the feasibility of the automated audio and video transcriptions."

Concerning the distributional approach, we were interested not only in how well the model describes selectional preferences, but moreover which second-order properties are most salient. For example, a typical direct object of the verb 'drink' is usually fluid, might be hot or cold, can be bought, might be bottled, etc. The general question we ask is: what characterises the predicate's restrictions to the semantic realisation of its complements? Our second interest lies in the actual comparison of the models: How does a very simple distributional model compare to much more complex approaches, and which representation of selectional preferences is more appropriate, using (i) second-order properties, (ii) an implicit generalisation of nouns (by clusters), or (iii) an explicit generalisation of nouns by WordNet classes within clusters? We describe various experiments on German data and two evaluations, and demonstrate that the simple distributional model outperforms the more complex cluster-based models in most cases, but does itself not always beat the powerful frequency baseline."

The probabilistic verb class model underlying the semantic classes is trained by a combination of the EM algorithm and the MDL principle, providing soft clusters with two dimensions (verb senses and subcategorisation frames with selectional preferences) as a result. A language-model-based evaluation shows that after 10 training iterations the verb class model results are above the baseline results."

They represent automatic, corpus-derived summaries of the wordsÂ grammatical and collocational behaviour. Besides the corpus itself, word sketches require a sketch grammar, a regular expression-based shallow grammar over the part-of-speech tags, to extract evidence for the properties of the targeted words from the corpus. The paper presents a sketch grammar for German, a language which is not strictly configurational and which shows a considerable amount of case syncretism, and evaluates its accuracy, which has not been done for other sketch grammars. The evaluation focuses on NP case as a crucial part of the German grammar. We present various versions of NP definitions, so demonstrating the influence of grammar detail on precision and recall."

However, distributional models that use corpus data as their basis have one well-known disadvantage: even though the distributional features based on corpus co-occurrence were often successful in capturing meaning aspects of the words to be described, they generally fail to capture those meaning aspects that refer to world knowledge, because coherent texts tend not to provide redundant information that is presumably available knowledge. The question we ask in this paper is whether dictionary and encyclopaedic resources might complement the distributional information in corpus data, and provide world knowledge that is missing in corpora. As test case for meaning aspects, we rely on a collection of semantic associates to German verbs and nouns. Our results indicate that a combination of the knowledge resources should be helpful in work on distributional descriptions."

We focus on the acquisition of semantic classes for Catalan adjectives, and show that polysemy acquisition naturally suits architectures used for multilabel classification. Furthermore, we explore the performance of information drawn from different levels of linguistic description, using feature sets based on morphology, syntax, semantics, and n-gram distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that ensemble classifiers are a powerful and adequate way to combine different types of linguistic evidence: a simple, majority voting ensemble classifier improves the accuracy from 62.5% (best single classifier) to 84%."

Assuming that the associations model aspects of verb meaning, we apply a clustering to the verbs, as based on the associations, and validate the resulting verb classes against standard approaches to semantic verb classes, i.e. GermaNet and FrameNet. Then, various clusterings of the same verbs are performed on the basis of standard corpus-based types, and evaluated against the association-based clustering as well as GermaNet and FrameNet classes. We hypothesise that the corpus-based clusterings are better if the instantiations of the feature types show more overlap with the verb associations, and that the associations therefore help to identify salient feature types."

To evaluate our claims, the association-based classification is validated against two standard approaches to semantic verb classes, GermaNet and FrameNet."

The primary goals of the experiments are (1) to empirically utilize and investigate the well-established relationship between verb meaning and verb behavior within a cluster analysis and (2) to investigate the required technical parameters of a cluster analysis with respect to this specific linguistic task. The clustering methodology is developed on a small-scale verb set and then applied to a larger-scale verb set including 883 German verbs."

Although the accuracy scores are quite similar with the two resulting classifications, the kinds of mistakes are qualitatively very different. Morphology can be used as a baseline classification, and syntax can be used as a clue when there are mismatches between morphology and semantics."

But clustering in the very high dimensional spaces that we use is fraught with technical and conceptual difficulties. Spectral clustering performs a dimensionality reduction on the verb frame patterns, and provides a robustness and efficiency that standard clustering methods do not display in direct use. The clustering results are evaluated according to the alignment (Christianini et al., 2002) between the Gram matrix defined by the cluster output and the corresponding matrix defined by a gold standard."

We developed a simple methodology to utilise frequency distributions in the lexicalised version of the probabilistic grammar for inducing syntactic verb frame descriptions. The frame definition is variable with respect to the inclusion of prepositional phrase refinement. An evaluation against a manual dictionary justifies the utilisation of the machine-readable lexicon as a valuable component for supporting NLP-tasks. As to our knowledge, no former computational approach has obtained a subcategorisation lexicon for German comparable in size (the number of verbs in the lexicon), restriction (no limit concerning the frequencies of the verbs), or verified reliability (successful extensive evaluation against dictionary)."
