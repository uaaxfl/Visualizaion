While recent progress incorporating pre-trained contextualized representations into neural encoders has greatly improved SRL F1 performance on popular benchmarks, the potential costs and benefits of structured decoding in these models have become less clear. With extensive experiments on PropBank SRL datasets, we find that more structured decoding methods outperform BIO-tagging when using static (word type) embeddings across all experimental settings. However, when used in conjunction with pre-trained contextualized word representations, the benefits are diminished. We also experiment in cross-genre and cross-lingual settings and find similar trends. We further perform speed comparisons and provide analysis on the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs among different decoding methods."

Focusing on the less explored unsupervised learning scenario, we compare the two model classes side by side and find that they tend to make different types of errors even when achieving comparable performance. We analyze the distributions of different error classes using two unsupervised tasks as testbeds: converting informally romanized text into the native script of its language (for Russian, Arabic, and Kannada) and translating between a pair of closely related languages (Serbian and Bosnian). Finally, we investigate how combining finite-state and sequence-to-sequence models at decoding time affects the output quantitatively and qualitatively."

Many of the existing style transfer benchmarks primarily focus on individual high-level semantic changes (e.g. positive to negative), which enable controllability at a high level but do not offer fine-grained control involving sentence structure, emphasis, and content of the sentence. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, StylePTB, with (1) paired sentences undergoing 21 fine-grained stylistic changes spanning atomic lexical, syntactic, semantic, and thematic transfers of text, as well as (2) compositions of multiple transfers which allow modeling of fine-grained stylistic changes as building blocks for more complex, high-level transfers. By benchmarking existing methods on StylePTB, we find that they struggle to model fine-grained changes and have an even more difficult time composing multiple styles. As a result, StylePTB brings novel challenges that we hope will encourage future research in controllable text style transfer, compositional models, and learning disentangled representations. Solving these challenges would present important steps towards controllable text generation."

We build a system that, given a statement, retrieves counterevidence from diverse sources on the Web. At the core of this system is a natural language inference (NLI) model that determines whether a candidate sentence is valid counterevidence or not. Most NLI models to date, however, lack proper reasoning abilities necessary to find counterevidence that involves complex inference. Thus, we present a knowledge-enhanced NLI model that aims to handle causality- and example-based inference by incorporating knowledge graphs. Our NLI model outperforms baselines for NLI tasks, especially for instances that require the targeted inference. In addition, this NLI model further improves the counterevidence retrieval system, notably finding complex counterevidence better."

Cross-lingual learning can improve performance in this setting by transferring knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource ones. Moreover, we hypothesize that annotations of syntactic dependencies can be leveraged to further facilitate cross-lingual transfer. In this work, we perform an empirical exploration of the helpfulness of syntactic supervision for crosslingual SRL within a simple multitask learning scheme. With comprehensive evaluations across ten languages (in addition to English) and three SRL benchmark datasets, including both dependency- and span-based SRL, we show the effectiveness of syntactic supervision in low-resource scenarios."

Our research goal asks whether neural models can similarly benefit from envisioning the question scenario before answering a defeasible query. Our approach is, given a question, to have a model first create a graph of relevant influences, and then leverage that graph as an additional input when answering the question. Our system, CURIOUS, achieves a new state-of-the-art on three different defeasible reasoning datasets. This result is significant as it illustrates that performance can be improved by guiding a system to {``}think about{''} a question and explicitly model the scenario, rather than answering reflexively."

Thus, it is important for real-world dialog systems to be able to handle popular figurative language constructs like metaphor and simile. In this work, we analyze the performance of existing dialog models in situations where the input dialog context exhibits use of figurative language. We observe large gaps in handling of figurative language when evaluating the models on two open domain dialog datasets. When faced with dialog contexts consisting of figurative language, some models show very large drops in performance compared to contexts without figurative language. We encourage future research in dialog modeling to separately analyze and report results on figurative language in order to better test model capabilities relevant to real-world use. Finally, we propose lightweight solutions to help existing models become more robust to figurative language by simply using an external resource to translate figurative language to literal (non-figurative) forms while preserving the meaning to the best extent possible."

We conclude that there is substantial room for progress before QA systems can be effectively deployed, highlight the need for QA evaluation to expand to consider real-world use, and hope that our findings will spur greater community interest in the issues that arise when our systems actually need to be of utility to humans."

However, to what extent was the information encoded in sentence representations, as discovered through a probe, actually used by the model to perform its task? In this work, we examine this probing paradigm through a case study in Natural Language Inference, showing that models can learn to encode linguistic properties even if they are not needed for the task on which the model was trained. We further identify that pretrained word embeddings play a considerable role in encoding these properties rather than the training task itself, highlighting the importance of careful controls when designing probing experiments. Finally, through a set of controlled synthetic tasks, we demonstrate models can encode these properties considerably above chance-level, even when distributed in the data as random noise, calling into question the interpretation of absolute claims on probing tasks."

Transformer{'}s predictions are widely explained by the attention weights, i.e., a probability distribution generated at its self-attention unit (head). Current empirical studies provide shreds of evidence that attention weights are not explanations by proving that they are not unique. A recent study showed theoretical justifications to this observation by proving the non-identifiability of attention weights. For a given input to a head and its output, if the attention weights generated in it are unique, we call the weights identifiable. In this work, we provide deeper theoretical analysis and empirical observations on the identifiability of attention weights. Ignored in the previous works, we find the attention weights are more identifiable than we currently perceive by uncovering the hidden role of the key vector. However, the weights are still prone to be non-unique attentions that make them unfit for interpretation. To tackle this issue, we provide a variant of the encoder layer that decouples the relationship between key and value vector and provides identifiable weights up to the desired length of the input. We prove the applicability of such variations by providing empirical justifications on varied text classification tasks.

Style is formed by a complex combination of different stylistic factors, including formality markers, emotions, metaphors, etc. One cannot form a complete understanding of a text without considering these factors. The factors combine and co-vary in complex ways to form styles. Studying the nature of the covarying combinations sheds light on stylistic language in general, sometimes called cross-style language understanding. This paper provides the benchmark corpus (XSLUE) that combines existing datasets and collects a new one for sentence-level cross-style language understanding and evaluation. The benchmark contains text in 15 different styles under the proposed four theoretical groupings: figurative, personal, affective, and interpersonal groups. For valid evaluation, we collect an additional diagnostic set by annotating all 15 styles on the same text. Using XSLUE, we propose three interesting cross-style applications in classification, correlation, and generation. First, our proposed cross-style classifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall classification performance against individually-trained style classifiers. Second, our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in human-written text. Finally, we find that combinations of some contradictive styles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text. We believe our benchmark and case studies help explore interesting future directions for cross-style research. The preprocessed datasets and code are publicly available."

Recently, graph neural networks over dependency trees have been explored to explicitly model connections between aspects and opinion words. However, the improvement is limited due to the inaccuracy of the dependency parsing results and the informal expressions and complexity of online reviews. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a dual graph convolutional networks (DualGCN) model that considers the complementarity of syntax structures and semantic correlations simultaneously. Particularly, to alleviate dependency parsing errors, we design a SynGCN module with rich syntactic knowledge. To capture semantic correlations, we design a SemGCN module with self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose orthogonal and differential regularizers to capture semantic correlations between words precisely by constraining attention scores in the SemGCN module. The orthogonal regularizer encourages the SemGCN to learn semantically correlated words with less overlap for each word. The differential regularizer encourages the SemGCN to learn semantic features that the SynGCN fails to capture. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our DualGCN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and verify the effectiveness of our model."

In this work, we ask the question: \textit{do probing studies shed light on systematic knowledge in BERT representations?} As a case study, we examine hypernymy knowledge encoded in BERT representations. In particular, we demonstrate through a simple consistency probe that the ability to correctly retrieve hypernyms in cloze tasks, as used in prior work, does not correspond to systematic knowledge in BERT. Our main conclusion is cautionary: even if BERT demonstrates high probing accuracy for a particular competence, it does not necessarily follow that BERT {`}understands{'} a concept, and it cannot be expected to systematically generalize across applicable contexts."

However, those models capture unnecessary event-specific biases, like the location of the event, which affect the generalizability and performance of the classifiers on new unseen data from an emerging new event. In our work, we train an adversarial neural model to remove latent event-specific biases and improve the performance on tweet importance classification."

Humans often make structural decisions on what and how to say about before making utterances. Guiding surface realization with such high-level decisions and structuring text in a coherent way is essentially called a planning process. Where can the model learn such high-level coherence? A paragraph itself contains various forms of inductive coherence signals called self-supervision in this work, such as sentence orders, topical keywords, rhetorical structures, and so on. Motivated by that, this work proposes a new paragraph completion task PARCOM; predicting masked sentences in a paragraph. However, the task suffers from predicting and selecting appropriate topical content with respect to the given context. To address that, we propose a self-supervised text planner SSPlanner that predicts what to say first (content prediction), then guides the pretrained language model (surface realization) using the predicted content. SSPlanner outperforms the baseline generation models on the paragraph completion task in both automatic and human evaluation. We also find that a combination of noun and verb types of keywords is the most effective for content selection. As more number of content keywords are provided, overall generation quality also increases."

Next, we find that linear combinations of these heads, estimated with approx. 11{\%} of available total event argument detection supervision, can push performance well higher for some roles {---} highest two being Victim (68.29{\%} Accuracy) and Artifact (58.82{\%} Accuracy). Furthermore, we investigate how well our methods do for cross-sentence event arguments. We propose a procedure to isolate {``}best heads{''} for cross-sentence argument detection separately of those for intra-sentence arguments. The heads thus estimated have superior cross-sentence performance compared to their jointly estimated equivalents, albeit only under the unrealistic assumption that we already know the argument is present in another sentence. Lastly, we seek to isolate to what extent our numbers stem from lexical frequency based associations between gold arguments and roles. We propose NONCE, a scheme to create adversarial test examples by replacing gold arguments with randomly generated {``}nonce{''} words. We find that learnt linear combinations are robust to NONCE, though individual best heads can be more sensitive."

Downstream task-based comparisons are often difficult to interpret due to differences in task structure, while probing task evaluations often look at only a few attributes and models. We address both of these issues by evaluating a diverse set of eight neural entity embedding methods on a set of simple probing tasks, demonstrating which methods are able to remember words used to describe entities, learn type, relationship and factual information, and identify how frequently an entity is mentioned. We also compare these methods in a unified framework on two entity linking tasks and discuss how they generalize to different model architectures and datasets."

Prior studies have shown that some individuals can predict the outcome of future events with consistently better accuracy. This leads to a natural question: what makes some forecasters better than others? In this paper we explore connections between the language people use to describe their predictions and their forecasting skill. Datasets from two different forecasting domains are explored: (1) geopolitical forecasts from Good Judgment Open, an online prediction forum and (2) a corpus of company earnings forecasts made by financial analysts. We present a number of linguistic metrics which are computed over text associated with people{'}s predictions about the future including: uncertainty, readability, and emotion. By studying linguistic factors associated with predictions, we are able to shed some light on the approach taken by skilled forecasters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict forecasting skill using a model that is based solely on language. This could potentially be useful for identifying accurate predictions or potentially skilled forecasters earlier."

Experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local, discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. The blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each other{'}s context. Furthermore, through ablations, we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging. Our experiments show that there is a significant performance gap between advanced models (72{\%}) and humans (87{\%}), encouraging future models to bridge this gap."

To reduce the number of candidates, we adopt a two-step approach, decomposing the problem into two sub-problems: argument head-word detection and head-to-span expansion. Evaluated on the recent RAMS dataset (Ebner et al., 2020), our model achieves overall better performance than a strong sequence labeling baseline. We further provide detailed error analysis, presenting where the model mainly makes errors and indicating directions for future improvements. It remains a challenge to detect implicit arguments, calling for more future work of document-level modeling for this task."

Current state-of-the-art methods are typically trained on large-scale datasets, but their performances do not directly transfer to low-resource domain-specific settings. In this paper, we propose two approaches for domain adaptation in the biological domain that involves pre-training LSTM-CRF based on existing large-scale datasets and adapting it for a low-resource corpus of biological processes. Our first approach defines a mapping between the source labels and the target labels, and the other approach modifies the final CRF layer in sequence-labeling neural network architecture. We perform our experiments on ProcessBank dataset which contains less than 200 paragraphs on biological processes. We improve over the previous state-of-the-art system on this dataset by 21 F1 points. We also show that, by incorporating event-event relationship in ProcessBank, we are able to achieve an additional 2.6 F1 gain, giving us possible insights into how to improve SRL systems for biological process using richer annotations."

Propositions are the basic units of an argument and the primary building blocks of most argument mining systems. However, they are usually substituted by argumentative discourse units obtained via surface-level text segmentation, which may yield text segments that lack semantic information necessary for subsequent argument mining processes. In contrast, our cascade model aims to extract complete propositions by handling anaphora resolution, text segmentation, reported speech, questions, imperatives, missing subjects, and revision. We formulate each task as a computational problem and test various models using a corpus of the 2016 U.S. presidential debates. We show promising performance for some tasks and discuss main challenges in proposition extraction."

In this work, we show that existing embedding models are inadequate at constructing representations that capture salient aspects of mathematical meaning for numbers, which is important for language understanding. Numbers are ubiquitous and frequently appear in text. Inspired by cognitive studies on how humans perceive numbers, we develop an analysis framework to test how well word embeddings capture two essential properties of numbers: magnitude (e.g. 3{\textless}4) and numeration (e.g. 3=three). Our experiments reveal that most models capture an approximate notion of magnitude, but are inadequate at capturing numeration. We hope that our observations provide a starting point for the development of methods which better capture numeracy in NLP systems."

Results show that our proposed metric can evaluate machine translation based on word meaning. Moreover, for distance, cosine similarity and word position information are used to address word-order differences.

Specifically, we compare encoders and decoders based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and modified self-attentive architectures. The former relies on sequential information while the latter is more flexible at modeling word order. Rigorous experiments and detailed analysis shows that RNN-based architectures transfer well to languages that are close to English, while self-attentive models have better overall cross-lingual transferability and perform especially well on distant languages."

This training scheme lets us iteratively train models that provide guidance to subsequent ones to search for logical forms of increasing complexity, thus dealing with the problem of spuriousness. We evaluate these techniques on two hard datasets: WikiTableQuestions (WTQ) and Cornell Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR), and show that our training algorithm outperforms the previous best systems, on WTQ in a comparable setting, and on NLVR with significantly less supervision."

These text formatting devices help the writer to effectively convey the narrative. At the same time, these help the readers pick up the structure of the discourse and comprehend the conveyed information. There have been a number of linguistic theories on discourse structure of text. However, these theories only consider unformatted text. Multimedia text contains rich formatting features that can be leveraged for various NLP tasks. In this article, we study some of these discourse features in multimedia text and what communicative function they fulfill in the context. As a case study, we use these features to harvest structured subject knowledge of geometry from textbooks. We conclude that the discourse and text layout features provide information that is complementary to lexical semantic information. Finally, we show that the harvested structured knowledge can be used to improve an existing solver for geometry problems, making it more accurate as well as more explainable."

We release PASTEL, the parallel and annotated stylistic language dataset, that contains {\textasciitilde}41K parallel sentences (8.3K parallel stories) annotated across different personas. Each persona has different styles in conjunction: gender, age, country, political view, education, ethnic, and time-of-writing. The dataset is collected from human annotators with solid control of input denotation: not only preserving original meaning between text, but promoting stylistic diversity to annotators. We test the dataset on two interesting applications of style language, where PASTEL helps design appropriate experiment and evaluation. First, in predicting a target style (e.g., male or female in gender) given a text, multiple styles of PASTEL make other external style variables controlled (or fixed), which is a more accurate experimental design. Second, a simple supervised model with our parallel text outperforms the unsupervised models using nonparallel text in style transfer. Our dataset is publicly available."

We find that while position exhibits substantial bias in news articles, this is not the case, for example, with academic papers and meeting minutes. Furthermore, our empirical study shows that different types of summarization systems (e.g., neural-based) are composed of different degrees of the sub-aspects.

However, directly modeling the joint distribution of all tokens simultaneously is challenging, and even with increasingly complex model structures accuracy lags significantly behind autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective model for non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative flow, an elegant technique to model complex distributions using neural networks, and design several layers of flow tailored for modeling the conditional density of sequential latent variables. We evaluate this model on three neural machine translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive NMT models and almost constant decoding time w.r.t the sequence length."

Our two proposed models incorporate each form of relations into document-level language models: the former is a supervised model that jointly learns a language model as well as discourse relation prediction, and the latter is an unsupervised model that is hierarchically conditioned by a recurrent neural network (RNN) over the latent information.

The stack tracks the status of the depth-first search and the pointer networks select one child for the word at the top of the stack at each step. The StackPtr parser benefits from the information of whole sentence and all previously derived subtree structures, and removes the left-to-right restriction in classical transition-based parsers. Yet the number of steps for building any (non-projective) parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence just as other transition-based parsers, yielding an efficient decoding algorithm with $O(n^2)$ time complexity.

However, applying stylistic variations is still by and large a manual process, and there have been little efforts towards automating it. In this paper we explore automated methods to transform text from modern English to Shakespearean English using an end to end trainable neural model with pointers to enable copy action. To tackle limited amount of parallel data, we pre-train embeddings of words by leveraging external dictionaries mapping Shakespearean words to modern English words as well as additional text. Our methods are able to get a BLEU score of 31+, an improvement of {\mbox{$\approx$}} 6 points above the strongest baseline. We publicly release our code to foster further research in this area."

We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4{\%} absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4{\%} relative reduction in errors."

Using labeled article edits, we build a computational classifier of intentions that achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.621. We use this model to investigate edit intention effectiveness: how different types of edits predict the retention of newcomers and changes in the quality of articles, two key concerns for Wikipedia today.

We define a novel problem of generating explanations of a time series event by (1) searching cause and effect relationships of the time series with textual data and (2) constructing a connecting chain between them to generate an explanation. To detect causal features from text, we propose a novel method based on the Granger causality of time series between features extracted from text such as N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition. The generation of the sequence of causal entities requires a commonsense causative knowledge base with efficient reasoning. To ensure good interpretability and appropriate lexical usage we combine symbolic and neural representations, using a neural reasoning algorithm trained on commonsense causal tuples to predict the next cause step. Our quantitative and human analysis show empirical evidence that our method successfully extracts meaningful causality relationships between time series with textual features and generates appropriate explanation between them."

One proposed alternative to the status quo is to automate or semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy policy text, using a combination of crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning. However, there has been a relative dearth of datasets appropriate for identifying data practices in privacy policies. To remedy this problem, we introduce a corpus of 115 privacy policies (267K words) with manual annotations for 23K fine-grained data practices.

The first applies graph smoothing as a postprocessing step to tease the vectors of different senses apart, and is applicable to any vector space model. The second adapts predictive maximum likelihood models that learn word embeddings with latent variables representing senses grounded in an specified ontology. Empirical results on lexical semantic tasks show that our approaches effectively captures information from both the ontology and distributional statistics.

We investigate 4 tasks: (1) sentiment classification at the sentence level and phrase level; (2) matching questions to answerphrases; (3) discourse parsing; (4) semantic relation extraction. Our goal is to understand better when, and why, recursive models can outperform simpler models. We find that recursive models help mainly on tasks (like semantic relation extraction) that require longdistance connection modeling, particularly on very long sequences. We then introduce a method for allowing recurrent models to achieve similar performance: breaking long sentences into clause-like units at punctuation and processing them separately before combining. Our results thus help understand the limitations of both classes of models, and suggest directions for improving recurrent models."

First, we introduce a multiclass logistic regression model that can detect subevent relations in addition to full coreference. Second, we propose a method to improve subevent structure based on subevent clusters detected by the model. Using a corpus in the Intelligence Community domain, we show that the method achieves over 3.2 BLANC F1 gain in detecting subevent relations against the logistic regression model."

To solve the challenge of ordering a set of sentences into coherent order, existing approaches focus mostly on defining and using sophisticated features to capture the cross-sentence argumentation logic and syntactic relationships. But both argumentation semantics and crosssentence syntax (such as coreference and tense rules) are very hard to formalize. In this paper, we introduce a neural network model for the coherence task based on distributed sentence representation. The proposed approach learns a syntacticosemantic representation for sentences automatically, using either recurrent or recursive neural networks. The architecture obviated the need for feature engineering, and learns sentence representations, which are to some extent able to capture the xe2x80x98rulesxe2x80x99 governing coherent sentence structure.

Our model learns to differentiate between normal and anomalous events. We model anomaly detection as a binary classification problem and show that the model learns useful features to classify anomaly. We use headlines from the weird news category publicly available on newswire websites to extract anomalous training examples and those from Gigaword as normal examples. We evaluate the classifier on human annotated data and obtain an accuracy of 65.44%. We also show that our model is at least as competent as the least competent human annotator in anomaly detection.

However, since almost any word can serve as a metaphor, they are impossible to list. To identify metaphorical use, we assume that it results in unusual semantic patterns between the metaphor and its dependencies. To identify these cases, we use SVMs with tree-kernels on a balanced corpus of 3872 instances, created by bootstrapping from available metaphor lists. 1 We outperform two baselines, a sequential and a vectorbased approach, and achieve an F1-score of 0.75."

Different from most similar metrics, our proposed metric does not depend heavily on sentence length. In most metrics based on f-measure comparisons of reference and candidate translations, the relative weight of each mismatched word in short sentences is larger than it in long sentences. Therefore, the evaluation score becomes disproportionally low in short sentences even when only one non-matching word exists. In our metric, the weight of each mismatched word is kept small even in short sentences. We designate our metric as Automatic Evaluation Metric that is Independent of Sentence Length (AILE). Experimental results indicate that AILE has the highest correlation with human judgments among some leading metrics."

We match performance of more complex state-of-the-art systems and perform well even under adversarial conditions. We show considerable improvements over standard baselines, both for predicted label accuracy and trustworthiness estimates. The latter can be further improved by introducing a prior on model parameters and using Variational Bayes inference.

In this paper we measure the effectiveness of very limited initial constraints: specifically, annotations of a small number of words in the training data. We vary the amount and distribution of initial partial annotations, and compare the results to unsupervised and supervised approaches. We find that partial annotations improve accuracy and can reduce the need for random restarts, which speeds up training time considerably."

The results of an exploratory study carried out over a large archive of Twitter messages demonstrates both the value of the microblog event retrieval task and the effectiveness of our proposed search methodologies."

The traditional extensional and intensional models of semantics are difficult to actually flesh out in practice, and no large-scale models of this kind exist. Recently, researchers in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have increasingly treated topic signature word distributions (also called 'context vectors', 'topic models', 'language models', etc.) as a de facto placeholder for semantics at various levels of granularity. This talk argues for a new kind of semantics that combines traditional symbolic logic-based proposition-style semantics (of the kind used in older NLP) with (computation-based) statistical word distribution information (what is being called Distributional Semantics in modern NLP). The core resource is a single lexico-semantic 'lexicon' that can be used for a variety of tasks. I show how to define such a lexicon, how to build and format it, and how to use it for various tasks. Combining the two views of semantics opens many fascinating questions that beg study, including the operation of logical operators such as negation and modalities over word(sense) distributions, the nature of ontological facets required to define concepts, and the action of compositionality over statistical concepts."

By 'granularity' we mean the level of detail of description of an event or object. Humans can seamlessly shift their granularity perspective while reading or understanding a text. To emulate this mechanism, we describe a set of features that identify the levels of granularity in text, and empirically verify this feature set using a human annotation study for granularity identification. This theory is the foundation for any system that can learn the (global) behavior of event descriptions from (local) behavior descriptions.

From a corpus of 1.4m sentences, we learn about 250k simple propositions about American football in the form of predicate-argument structures like quarterbacks throw passes to receivers. Using several statistical measures, we show that our model is able to generalize and explain the data statistically significantly better than various baseline approaches.

The classes and probabilistic model can be used in textual enrichment to improve the performance of LbR end-to-end systems."

They therefore treat the source text corpus as a network, in which words are the nodes and relations linking them are the edges. The results of computational network analysis, especially from the world wide web, are thus applicable. Surprisingly, these results have not yet been broadly introduced into the computational linguistics community.

In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing.

W10-3401,Distributional Semantics and the Lexicon,2010,0,0,1,1,1043,eduard hovy,Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon,0,"The lexicons used in computational linguistics systems contain morphological, syntactic, and occasionally also some semantic information (such as definitions, pointers to an ontology, verb frame filler preferences, etc.). But the human cognitive lexicon contains a great deal more, crucially, expectations about how a word tends to combine with others: not just general information-extraction-like patterns, but specific instantial expectations. Such information is very useful when it comes to listening in bad aural conditions and reading texts in which background information is taken for granted; without such specific expectation, one would be hard-pressed (and computers are completely unable) to form coherent and richly connected multi-sentence interpretations. Over the past few years, NLP work has increasingly treated topic signature word distributions (also called xe2x80x98context vectorsxe2x80x99, xe2x80x98topic modelsxe2x80x99, etc.) as a de facto replacement for semantics. Whether the task is wordsense disambiguation, certain forms of textual entailment, information extraction, paraphrase learning, and so on, it turns out to be very useful to consider a word(sense) as being defined by the distribution of word(senses) that regularly accompany it (in the classic words of Firth, xe2x80x9cyou shall know a word by the company it keepsxe2x80x9d). And this is true not only for individual wordsenses, but also for larger units such as topics: the product of LDA and similar topic characterization engines is similar. In this talk I argue for a new kind of semantics, which is being called Distributional Semantics. It combines traditional symbolic logicbased semantics with (computation-based) statistical word distribution information. The core resource is a single lexico-semantic lexicon that can be used for a variety of tasks, provided that it is reformulated accordingly. I show how to define such a semantics, how to build the appropriate lexicon, how to format it, and how to use it for various tasks. The talk pulls together a wide range of related topics, including Pantel-style resources like DIRT, inferences / expectations such as those used in Schank-style expectation-based parsing and expectation-driven NLU, PropBank-style word valence lexical items, and the treatment of negation and modalities. I conclude by arguing that the human cognitive lexicon has to have the same kinds of properties as the Distributional Semantics lexicon, given the ways people do things with words."

We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using verb, noun, and verb prep lexico-syntactic patterns. Human-based evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge."

We propose a general framework that uses patterns in bootstrapping fashion to learn open-class semantic lexicons for different kinds of relations. These patterns require seeds. To estimate the goodness (the potential yield) of new seeds, we introduce a regression model that considers the connectivity behavior of the seed during bootstrapping. The generalized regression model is evaluated on six different kinds of relations with over 10000 different seeds for English and Spanish patterns. Our approach reaches robust performance of 90% correlation coefficient with 15% error rate for any of the patterns when predicting the goodness of seeds."

In real text, this is often a difficult decision because identity is never adequately defined, leading to contradictory treatment of cases in previous work. This paper introduces the concept of 'near-identity', a middle ground category between identity and non-identity, to handle such cases systematically. We present a typology of Near-Identity Relations (NIDENT) that includes fifteen typesâgrouped under four main familiesâthat capture a wide range of ways in which (near-)coreference relations hold between discourse entities. We validate the theoretical model by annotating a small sample of real data and showing that inter-annotator agreement is high enough for stability (K=0.58, and up to K=0.65 and K=0.84 when leaving out one and two outliers, respectively). This work enables subsequent creation of the first internally consistent language resource of this type through larger annotation efforts."

Comparing results with WordNet, we find that the algorithm misses some concepts and links, but also that it discovers many additional ones lacking in WordNet. We evaluate the taxonomization power of our method on reconstructing parts of the WordNet taxonomy. Experiments show that starting from scratch, the algorithm can reconstruct 62% of the WordNet taxonomy for the regions tested."

However, the general approaches used today, and specifically the methods of evaluating results, exhibit serious shortcomings. Harvesting without focusing on a specific conceptual area may deliver large numbers of terms, but they are scattered over an immense concept space, making Recall judgments impossible. Regarding Precision, simply judging the correctness of terms and their individual classification links may provide high scores, but this doesn't help with the eventual assembly of terms into a single coherent taxonomy. Furthermore, since there is no correct and complete gold standard to measure against, most work invents some ad hoc evaluation measure. We present an algorithm that is more precise and complete than previous ones for identifying from web text just those concepts 'below' a given seed term. Comparing the results to WordNet, we find that the algorithm misses terms, but also that it learns many new terms not in WordNet, and that it classifies them in ways acceptable to humans but different from WordNet."

Intuitively, a candidate is popular if it was discovered many times by other instances in the hyponym pattern. A candidate is productive if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances. Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also cross-checking that the candidate occurs both near the class name and near other class members. We developed two algorithms that begin with just a class name and one seed instance and then automatically generate a ranked list of new class instances. We conducted experiments on four semantic classes and consistently achieved high accuracies."

However, this framework does not work well for questions with hidden assumptions and implicatures. In this paper, we describe a novel idea, a cascading guidance strategy, which can not only identify potential traps in questions but further guide the answer extraction procedure by recognizing whether there are multiple answers for a question. This is the first attempt to solve implicature problem for complex QA in a cascading fashion using N-gram language models as features. We here investigate questions with implicatures related to biography facts in a web-based QA system, Power-Bio. We compare the performances of Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and ME (Maximum Entropy) classification methods. The integration of the cascading guidance strategy can help extract answers for questions with implicatures and produce satisfactory results in our experiments."

In this paper, we describe the creation of an interlingua and the development of a corpus of semantically annotated text, to be validated in six languages and evaluated in several ways. We have established a distributed, well-functioning research methodology, designed a preliminary interlingua notation, created annotation manuals and tools, developed a test collection in six languages with associated English translations, annotated some 150 translations, and designed and applied various annotation metrics. We describe the data sets being annotated and the interlingual (IL) representation language which uses two ontologies and a systematic theta-role list.

For 100-word summaries, the performance upper bound, 0.65, achieved oracle extracts3. Such oracle extracts show the promise of sentence extraction algorithms; however, we first need to raise inter-human agreement to be able to achieve this performance level. We show that compression is a promising direction and that the compression ratio of summaries affects average human and system performance."

Building such a complete rule-set is time-consuming and labor-intensive task whilst it doesn{'}t cover all the cases. Besides, when the scale of system increases, it is very difficult to control that rule-set.

FEMTI offers structured descriptions of potential user needs, linked to an overview of technical characteristics of MT systems. The description of possible systems is mainly articulated around the quality characteristics for software product set out in ISO/IEC standard 9126. Following the philosophy set out there and in the related 14598 series of standards, each quality characteristic bottoms out in metrics which may be applied to a particular instance of a system in order to judge how satisfactory the system is with respect to that characteristic. An evaluator can use the description of user needs to help identify the specific needs of his evaluation and the relations between them. He can then follow the pointers to system description to determine what metrics should be applied and how. In the current state of the framework, emphasis is on being exhaustive, including as much as possible of the information available in the literature on machine translation evaluation. Future work will aim at being more analytic, looking at characteristics and metrics to see how they relate to one another, validating metrics and investigating the correlation between particular metrics and human judgement."

W96-0508,On Lexical Aggregation and Ordering,1996,5,6,2,0,2663,hercules dalianis,Eighth International Natural Language Generation Workshop (Posters and Demonstrations),0,"Aggregation is the process of removing redundant information during language generation while preserving the information to be conveyed. Aggregation is an important component of text or sentence planning. Without aggregation, automated language generation systems would not be able to p roduce f luent text f rom real -wor ld databases and knowledge bases, since information is rarely stored in computers in forms directly supporting fluent expression. Various types of aggregation (syntactic, lexical, referential) have been identified in [Hovy88, Cook84, Reinhart91, Horacek92, Dalianis&Hovy93,Wilkinson95,Dalianis95a, 95b,96a]. This paper investigates lexical aggregation, the process by which a set of items is replaced with a single new lexeme that encompasses the same meaning. We call the elements that will be aggregated the aggregands and the element (the lexeme) which is the result of the aggregation the aggregator. Lexical aggregation can be divided into two major types, bounded and unbounded. With Bounded Lexical (BL) aggregation the aggregator lexeme covers a closed set of concepts and the redundancy is obvious, the aggregated information is recoverable, and the aggregation process must be carried out. In contrast, Unbounded Lexical (UL) aggregation is carried out over an open set of aggregands and consequently the aggregated information is not recoverable and has to be licensed by other factors, such as the hearer's goals. The example in Figure 1 contains both types of aggregation, where f ight and week are the unbounded and bounded aggregators respectively."

As illustrated in several systems [Hovy 88, Bateman & Paris 89, Paris 93], the same core communication may be realised in numerous different ways, depending (among other factors) on the nature and relation of the interlocutors, the context of the communication, the media employed, etc. The combinatoric number of possibilities of all such factors is extremely large. Since most of them are not well understood at this time, automated text generation may appear to be a hopeless endeavour."

The ontology supports semantic processing in a knowledge-based machine translation system by providing a set of language-neutral symbols and semantic information. To put the ontology to practical use, lexical items of each language of interest must be linked to appropriate ontology items. The association of ontology items with lexical items of various languages is a process fraught with difficulty: since much of this work depends on the subjective decisions of human workers, large MT dictionaries tend to be subject to some dispersion and inconsistency. The problem we focus on here is how to associate concepts in the ontology with Japanese lexical entities by automatic methods, since it is too difficult to define adequately many concepts manually. We have designed three algorithms to associate a Japanese lexicon with the concepts of the ontology automatically: the equivalent-word match, the argument match, and the example match. We simulated these algorithms for 980 nouns, 860 verbs and 520 adjectives as preliminary experiments. The algorithms are found to be effective for more than 80% of the words."

Given our belief that the a true language-neutral ontology of terms can only be approached asymptotically, the construction method outlined involves a stepwise folding in of one language at a time. This is effected in three steps: first building for each language a taxonomy of the linguistic generalizations required to analyze and generate that language, then organizing the domain entities in terms of that taxonomy, and finally merging the result with the existing interlingua ontology in a well-defined way. This methodology is based not on intuitive grounds about what is and is not 'true' about the world, which is a question of language-independence, but instead on practical concerns, namely what information the analysis and generation programs require in order to perform their tasks, a question of language-neutrality. After each merging is complete, the resulting taxonomy contains, declaratively and explicitly represented, those distinctions required to control the analysis and generation of the linguistic phenomena. The paper is based on current work of the PANGLOSS MT project."

As unification-based grammatical frameworks are extended to handle richer descriptions of linguistic information, they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems. This commonality suggests that some of the classification-based representation techniques can be applied to unification-based linguistic descriptions. This merging supports the integration of semantic and syntactic information into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more efficient parsing due to the increased organization of knowledge."

Unless NLP can succeed with the central task of machine translation, it cannot be considered successful as a field. We maintain that the most profitable approach to MT at the present time is an interlingual and modular one. MT is one the precious few computational tasks falling broadly within artificial intelligence (AI) that combine a fundamental intellectual research challenge with enormous proven need. To establish the latter, one only has to note that in Japan alone the current MT requirement is for 20 billion pages a year (a market of some $66 billion a year)."

At the same time, translation by computer (MT) is reaching the stage where it can deliver significant cost savings (systems are being sold in Japan that reputedly reduce the time required for translation by up to 50%). Although fully automated high-quality translation is technically not feasible today or in the near future, a number of recent theoretical developments make possible MT systens that are more powerful and effective than existing ones. These developments include: better representation techniques, a clearer understanding of semantics for translation, more complete grammars, and better generation and parsing technology. By making optimal use of existing technology, new MT projects can reach a sophisticated level of performance within a short time. This paper provides reasons for starting a new MT program and recommends the establishment of three small MT projects that address the same domain but use different theoretical frameworks."

A paragraph is coherent when the information in successive sentences follows some pattern of inference or of knowledge with which the hearer is familiar. To signal such inferences, speakers usually use relations that link successive sentences in fixed ways. A set of 20 relations that span most of what people usually say in English is proposed in the Rhetorical Structure Theory of Mann and Thompson. This paper describes the formalization of these relations and their use in a prototype text planner that structures input elements into coherent paragraphs."

So far, however, no-one has enumerated the kinds of tasks a text planner should be able to do. This paper describes the principal lesson learned in combining a number of planning tasks in a planner-realizer: planning and realization should be interleaved, in a limited-commitment planning paradigm, to perform two types of planning: prescriptive and restrictive. Limited-commitment planning consists of both prescriptive (hierarchical expansion) planning and of restrictive planning (selecting from options with reference to the status of active goals). At present, existing text planners use prescriptive plans exclusively. However, a large class of planner tasks, especially those concerned with the pragmatic (non-literal) content of text such as style and slant, is most easily performed under restrictive planning. The kinds of tasks suited to each planning style are listed, and a program that uses both styles is described."
