This has brought some inaccuracies and undesirbale limitations of the standard to light, which are addressed in a proposed second edition. This second edition allows a more accurate annotation of dependence relations and rhetorical relations in dialogue. Following the ISO 24617-4 principles of semantic annotation, and borrowing ideas from EmotionML, a triple-layered plug-in mechanism is introduced which allows dialogue act descriptions to be enriched with information about their semantic content, about accompanying emotions, and other information, and allows the annotation scheme to be customised by adding application-specific dialogue act types."

A proposed approach that combines ideas from the theory of generalised quantifiers and from neo-Davidsonian event semantics was adopted by the ISO organisation in 2019 as a starting point for developing such an annotation scheme. * This scheme consists of (1) a conceptual {`}metamodel{'} that visualises the types of entities, functions and relations that go into annotations of quantification; (2) an abstract syntax which defines {`}annotation structures{'} as triples and other set-theoretic constructs; (3) an XML-based representation of annotation structures ({`}concrete syntax{'}); and (4) a compositional semantics of annotation structures. The latter three components together define the interpreted markup language QuantML.

To identify, categorize and quantify salient features of patient-provider communication, to model interactive processes in medical encounters and to design digital interactive medical services, two important instruments have been developed: (1) medical interaction analysis systems with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) as the most widely used by medical practitioners and (2) dialogue act annotation schemes with ISO 24617-2 as a multidimensional taxonomy of interoperable semantic concepts widely used for corpus annotation and dialogue systems design. Neither instrument fits all purposes. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparative analysis of the categories defined in the RIAS and ISO taxonomies. Overcoming the deficiencies and gaps that were found, we propose a number of extensions to the ISO annotation scheme, making it a powerful analytical and modelling instrument for the analysis, modelling and assessment of medical communication."

The interpretation of expressions in the query implements a mapping from ISO 24617-2 concepts to those of the annotation scheme used in the corpus. We discuss two possible ways to query existing annotated corpora using DiAML. One way is to transform corpora into DiAML compliant format, and subsequently query these data using XQuery or XPath. The second approach is to define a DiAML query that can be directly used to retrieve requested information from the annotated data. Both approaches are valid. The first one presents a standard way of querying XML data. The second approach is a DiAML-oriented querying of dialogue act annotated data, for which we designed an interface. The proposed approach is tested on two important types of existing dialogue corpora: spoken two-person dialogue corpora collected and annotated within the HCRC Map Task paradigm, and multiparty face-to-face dialogues of the AMI corpus. We present the results and evaluate them with respect to accuracy and completeness through statistical comparisons between retrieved and manually constructed reference annotations."

The annotation scheme developed as international standard for dialogue act annotation ISO 24617-2 is based on the DIT++ scheme (Bunt, 2006; 2009) which combines the multidimensional DIT scheme (Bunt, 1994) with concepts from DAMSL (Allen and Core , 1997) and various other schemes. This scheme is designed in a such way that it can be applied not only to spoken dialogue, as is the case for most of the previously defined dialogue annotation schemes, but also to multimodal dialogue. This paper describes how the ISO 24617-2 annotation scheme can be used, together with the DIT++ method of Âmultidimensional segmentation', to annotate nonverbal and multimodal dialogue behaviour. We analyse the fundamental distinction between (a) the coding of surface features; (b) form-related semantic classification; and (c) semantic annotation in terms of dialogue acts, supported by experimental studies of (a) and (b). We discuss examples of specification languages for representing the results of each of these activities, show how dialogue act annotations can be attached to XML representations of functional segments of multimodal data."

ANVIL offers the use of multiple user-defined `tiers' for annotating various kinds of information. This is shown to be convenient not only for multimodal information but also for dialogue act annotation according to ISO standard 24617-2 because of the latter's multidimensionality: functional dialogue segments are viewed as expressing one or more dialogue acts, and every dialogue act belongs to one of a number of dimensions of communication, defined in the standard, for each of which a different ANVIL tier can conveniently be used. Annotations made in the multi-tier interface can be exported in the ISO 24617-2 format, thus supporting the creation of interoperable annotated corpora of multimodal dialogue."

Dybkjaer and Bernsen (2002), point out that coding schemes for multimodal data are used solely by their creators. Standardisation has been achieved to some extent for coding behavioural features for certain nonverbal expressions, e.g. for facial expression, however, for the semantic annotation of such expressions combined with other modalities such as speech there is still a long way to go. The majority of existing dialogue act annotation schemes that are designed to code semantic and pragmatic dialogue information are limited to analysis of spoken modality. This paper investigates the applicability of existing dialogue act annotation schemes to the semantic annotation of multimodal data, and the way a dialogue act annotation scheme can be extended to cover dialogue phenomena from multiple modalities. The general conclusion of our explorative study is that a multidimensional dialogue act taxonomy is usable for this purpose when some adjustments are made. We proposed a solution for adding these aspects to a dialogue act annotation scheme without changing its set of communicative functions, in the form of qualifiers that can be attached to communicative function tags."

Semantic role labeling is a case in point. This may be very useful, for instance for determining the variety of ways in which certain types of semantic information tend to be expressed, but it seems to me that semantic annotations can and should have a deeper significance and a more important role to play.n n Since semantic annotations are intended to capture some of the meaning of the annotated text, it ought to be possible to use such annotations in reasoning, and hence to apply that information in language processing tasks. However, reasoning with semantic annotations presupposes that the annotation language has a formal semantics. (In fact, one may wonder how much sense it makes to use a semantic annotation language without a semantics, since there is a priori little reason to assume that semantically undefined annotations would capture the meanings of natural language expressions any better than the expressions themselves.)n n Still, existing work in this area, for instance on semantic role annotation (as in the FrameNet and PropBank initiatives) or on the annotation of temporal information (as in the TimeML effort) makes use of uninterpreted annotation languages.n n In this talk, I will discuss some of the possibilities, perspectives, and problems in defining semantic annotation languages with a well-defined semantics. I will do this by starting from an attempt to integrate intermediate results from the design of a standard for temporal annotation in the International Organisation for Standards (ISO), and from the definition of annotation schemas for coreference annotation and semantic role labeling in the European project LIRICS. I will indicate the requirements for integrated and multilayered semantic annotation approaches, and certain general principles for semantic annotation. Moreover, I hope to address issues concerning the relations between using semantic annotations with a formal semantics on the one hand, and using underspecified semantic representations on the other. Finally, I will consider some of the potential applications of the use of interpreted semantic annotations in areas such as information extraction, paraphrase generation, and textual entailment."

It is argued that the agreement among naive annotators provides insight in the clarity of the tagset, whereas agreement among expert annotators provides an indication of how reliably the tagset can be applied when errors are ruled out that are due to deficiencies in understanding the concepts of the tagset, to a lack of experience in using the annotation tool, or to little experience in annotation more generally. An indication of the differences between the two groups in terms of inter-annotator agreement and tagging accuracy on task-oriented dialogue in different domains, annotated with the DIT++ dialogue act tagset is presented, and the annotations of both groups are assessed against a gold standard. Additionally, the effect of the reduction of the tagsetÂs granularity on the performances of both groups is looked into. In general, it is concluded that the annotations of both groups provide complementary insights in reliability, clarity, and more fundamental conceptual issues."

We present a formal semantics for a language for the integrated annotation of several types of semantic information, such as (co-)reference relations, temporal information, and semantic roles. This semantics has the form of a compositional translation into second-order logic. We show that a truly semantic approach to the annotation of different types of semantic information raises interesting issues relating to the borders between these areas of semantics, and to the consistency of semantic annotations in multiple areas or in multiple annotation layers. The approach is compositional, in the sense that every well-formed subexpression of the annotation language can be translated to formal logic (and hence interpreted) independent of the rest of the annotation structure. The approach is also incremental in the sense that it is designed to be extendable to the semantic annotation of many other types of semantic information, such as spatial information, noun-noun relations, or quantification and modification structures."

In this paper we outline how existing approaches to the annotation of temporal information, semantic roles, and reference relations can be integrated in a single XML-based format and can be given a formal semantics by translating them into second-order logic.

We introduce the use of per-dimension segmentation for dialogue act taxonomies that feature multi-functionality and show that better classification results are obtained when using a separate segmentation for each dimension than when using one segmentation that fits all dimensions. Three machine learning techniques are applied and compared on the task of automatic classification of multiple communicative functions of utterances. The results are encouraging and indicate that communicative functions in important dimensions are easy machinelearnable."

It is based on the multidimensional dialogue act taxonomy and associated context model as developed in Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT). The multidimensional organisation of the taxonomy reflects that there are various aspects that dialogue participants have to deal with simultaneously during a dialogue. Besides performing some underlying task, a participant also has to pay attention to various aspects of the communication process itself, including social conventions.n n Therefore, a multi-agent approach is proposed, in which for each of the dimensions in the taxonomy a specialised dialogue act agent is designed, dedicated to the generation of dialogue acts from that particular dimension. These dialogue act agents operate in parallel on the information state of the system. For a simplified version of the taxonomy, a dialogue manager has been implemented and integrated into an interactive QA system."

Two ideas seem to be prevalent in the literature concerning the notion of dimension: (1) dimensions correspond to different types of information; and (2) a dimension is formed by a set of mutually exclusive tags. In DAMSL, for instance, the terms ÂdimensionÂ and ÂlayerÂ are used sometimes in the sense of (1) and sometimes in that of (2). We argue that being mutually exclusive is not a good criterion for a set of dialogue act types to constitute a dimension, even though the description of an object in a multidimensional space should never assign more than one value per dimension. We define a dimension of dialogue act annotation as an aspect of participating in a dialogue that can be addressed independently by means of dialogue acts. We show that DAMSL dimensions such as Info-request, Statement, and Answer do not qualify as proper dimensions, and that the communicative functions in these categories do not fall in any specific dimension, but should be considered as Âgeneral-purposeÂ in the sense that they can be used in any dimension. We argue that using the notion of dimension that we propose, a multidimensional taxonomy of dialogue acts emerges that optimally supports multidimensional dialogue act annotation."
bunt-schiffrin-2006-methodological,Methodological Aspects of Semantic Annotation,2006,23,4,1,1,16745,harry bunt,Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}{'}06),0,"This paper constitutes a preliminary report on the work carried out on semantic content annotation in the LIRICS project, in close collaboration with the activities of ISO TC 37/SC 4/TDG 31. This consists primarily of: (1) identifying commonalities in alternative approaches to the annotation and representation of various types of semantic information; and (2) developing methodological principles and concepts for identifying and characterising representational concepts for semantic content. The LIRICS project does not aim to develop a standard format for the annotation and representation of semantic content, but at providing well-defined descriptive concepts. In particular, the aim is to build an on-line registry of definitions of such concepts, called Âdata categoriesÂ, in accordance with ISO standard 12620. These semantic data categories are abstract concepts, whose use is not restricted to any particular format or representation language. We advocate the use of the metamodel as a tool to extract the most important of these abstract overarching concepts, with examples from dialogue act, temporal, reference and semantic role annotation."

This independent expert group was founded on the instigation of the Interna- tional Organization for Standardisation ISO for investigating the possibilities to develop well-founded guidelines for the representation and annotation of semantic information in interactive multimodal contexts, with the aim to support the interoperability and reuse of multimodal and language resources."

1993.iwpt-1.4,Parsing as Dynamic Interpretation,1993,-1,-1,1,1,16745,harry bunt,Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Parsing Technologies,0,"In this paper we consider the merging of the language of feature structures with a formal logical language, and how the semantic definition of the resulting language can be used in parsing. For the logical language we use the language EL, defined and implemented earlier for computational semantic purposes. To this language we add the basic constructions and operations of feature structures. The extended language we refer to as {`}Generalized EL{'}, or {`}GEL{'}. The semantics of EL, and that of its extension GEL, is defined model-theoretically: for each construction of the language, a recursive rule describes how its value can be computed from the values of its constituents. Since GEL talks not only about semantic objects and their relations but also about syntactic concepts, GEL models are nonstandard in containing both kinds of entities. Whereas phrase-structure rules are traditionally viewed procedurally, as recipes for building phrases, and a rule in the parsing-as-deduction is viewed declaratively, as a proposition which is true when the conditions for building the phrase are satisfied, a rule in GEL is best viewed as a proposition in Dynamic Semantics: it can be evaluated recursively, and evaluates not to true or false, but to the minimal change in the model, needed to make the proposition true. The viability of this idea has been demonstrated by a proof-of-concept implementation for DPSG chart parsing and an emulation of HPSG parsing in the STUF environment."
E87-1034,"Discontinuous Constituents in Trees, Rules, and Parsing",1987,10,6,1,1,16745,harry bunt,Third Conference of the {E}uropean Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,0,"This paper discusses the consequences of allowing discontinuous constituents in syntactic representions and phrase-structure rules, and the resulting complications for a standard parser of phrase-structure grammar.It is argued, first, that discontinuous constituents seem inevitable in a phrase-structure grammar which is acceptable from a semantic point of view. It is shown that tree-like constituent structures with discontinuities can be given a precise definition which makes them just as acceptable for syntactic representation as ordinary trees. However, the formulation of phrase-structure rules that generate such structures entails quite intricate problems. The notions of linear precedence and adjacency are reexamined, and the concept of n-place adjacency sequence is introduced. Finally, the resulting form of phrase-structure grammar, called Discontinuous Phrase-Structure Grammar, is shown to be parsable by an algorithm for context-free parsing with relatively minor adaptations. The paper describes the adaptations in the chart parser which was implemented as part of the TENDUMdialogue system."
P84-1028,The Resolution of Quantificational Ambiguity in the {TENDUM} System,1984,6,2,1,1,16745,harry bunt,10th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 22nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"A method is described for handling the ambiguity and vagueness that is often found in quantifications - the semantically complex relations between nominal and verbal constituents. In natural language certain aspects of quantification are often left open; it is argued that the analysis of quantification in a model-theoretic framework should use semantic representation in which this may also be done. This paper shows a form for such a representation and how ambiguous representations are used in an elegant and efficient procedure for semantic analysis, incorporated in the TENDUM dialogue system."
