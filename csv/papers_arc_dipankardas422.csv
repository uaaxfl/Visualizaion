In contrast, similar tools for Indian Languages are scarce. This is because, state-of-the-art pre-processing tools like POS tagger, shallow parsers, etc., are not readily available for Indian languages. Although, such working tools for Indian languages, like Hindi and Bengali, that are spoken by the majority of the population, are available, finding the same for less spoken languages like, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam, is difficult. Moreover, due to the advent of social media, the multi-lingual population of India, who are comfortable with both English ad their regional language, prefer to communicate by mixing both languages. This gives rise to massive code-mixed content and automatically annotating them with their respective sentiment labels becomes a challenging task. In this work, we take up a similar challenge of developing a sentiment analysis model that can work with English-Tamil code-mixed data. The proposed work tries to solve this by using bi-directional LSTMs along with language tagging. Other traditional methods, based on classical machine learning algorithms have also been discussed in the literature, and they also act as the baseline systems to which we will compare our Neural Network based model. The performance of the developed algorithm, based on Neural Network architecture, garnered precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.59, 0.66, and 0.58 respectively."

We observed distinct phrase level linguistic patterns that hint the pres-ence of characters in different text spans. Such six patterns were used in order to extract the cha-racters. On the other hand, a distinguishing set of novel features (e.g., multi-word expression, nodes and paths of parse tree, immediate ancestors etc.) was employed. Further, the correlation of the features is also measured in order to identify the important features. Finally, we applied various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.) along with deep learning to classify the patterns as characters or non-characters in order to achieve decent accuracy. Evaluation shows that phrase level linguistic patterns as well as the adopted features are highly active in capturing characters and their adjectives."

Expanding the available synsets of the English WordNet Affect using SentiWordNet, we have performed the translation of the expanded lists into Japanese based on the synsetIDs in the Japanese WordNet. A baseline system for emotion analysis of Japanese sentences has been developed based on the Japanese WordNet Affect. The incorporation of morphology improves the performance of the system. Overall, the system achieves average precision, recall and F-scores of 32.76%, 53% and 40.49% respectively on 89 sentences of the Japanese judgment corpus and 83.52%, 49.58% and 62.22% on 1000 translated Japanese sentences of the SemEval 2007 affect sensing test corpus. Different experimental outcomes and morphological analysis suggest that irrespective of the google translation error, the performance of the system could be improved by enhancing the Japanese WordNet Affect in terms of coverage."
W11-0904,Identifying Event-Sentiment Association using Lexical Equivalence and Co-reference Approaches,2011,24,9,2,0,40689,anup kolya,Proceedings of the {ACL} 2011 Workshop on Relational Models of Semantics,0,"In this paper, we have identified event and sentiment expressions at word level from the sentences of TempEval-2010 corpus and evaluated their association in terms of lexical equivalence and co-reference. A hybrid approach that consists of Conditional Random Field (CRF) based machine learning framework in conjunction with several rule based strategies has been adopted for event identification within the TimeML framework. The strategies are based on semantic role labeling, WordNet relations and some handcrafted rules. The sentiment expressions are identified simply based on the cues that are available in the sentiment lexicons such as Subjectivity Wordlist, SentiWordNet and WordNet Affect. The identification of lexical equivalence between event and sentiment expressions based on the part-of-speech (POS) categories is straightforward. The emotional verbs from VerbNet have also been employed to improve the coverage of lexical equivalence. On the other hand, the association of sentiment and event has been analyzed using the notion of co-reference. The parsed dependency relations along with basic rhetoric knowledge help to identify the co-reference between event and sentiment expressions. Manual evaluation on the 171 sentences of TempEval-2010 dataset yields the precision, recall and F-Score values of 61.25%, 70.29% and 65.23% respectively."

MWE can be defined as a semantic issue of a phrase where the meaning of the phrase may not be obtained from its constituents in a straightforward manner. This paper presents an approach of identifying bigram noun-noun MWEs from a medium-size Bengali corpus by clustering the semantically related nouns and incorporating a vector space model for similarity measurement. Additional inclusion of the English WordNet::Similarity module also improves the results considerably. The present approach also contributes to locate clusters of the synonymous noun words present in a document. Experimental results draw a satisfactory conclusion after analyzing the Precision, Recall and F-score values."

Baseline system is developed based on WordNet Affect lists and dependency relations. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised framework is employed by incorporating different word and context level features. The feature analysis is carried out on 358 development sentences followed by Information Gain Based Pruning. Application of admissible tag sequences and a class-splitting technique improves the systemxe2x80x99s performance and reduces the label bias problem of SVM. The supervised system outperforms the baseline system and achieves average F-Scores of 82.72%, 76.74% and 89.21% for emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities respectively on 565 gold standard test sentences. A comparative evaluation shows that sentential emotion tagging based on emotional expressions, intensities and context features bridges the gap of identifying sentential emotion depending only on words."

Two types of strategies yield average agreement measures of 0.78 and 0.80 for annotating emotion holders with respect to all emotion classes. The baseline model is developed based on the combinations of various part-of-speech (POS) features extracted from the phrase-based similarities. The syntactic model is based on the argument structure of the sentences with respect to the verbs. If the acquired argument structure of a Bengali blog sentence with respect to its verb matches with any of the frame syntax retrieved for its equivalent English verb of identical sense from VerbNet, the holder role associated with the English VerbnNet frame is mapped to the appropriate slot in Bengali sentence. The syntactic model with an average F-score of 60.03% outperforms the baseline model with an average F-score of 50.85% on 500 test sentences."

The lexical patterns of compound and conjunct verbs are extracted based on the information of shallow morphology and available seed lists of verbs. Lexical scopes of compound and conjunct verbs in consecutive sequence of Complex Predicates (CPs) have been identified. The fine-grained error analysis through confusion matrix highlights some insufficiencies of lexical patterns and the impacts of different constraints that are used to identify the Complex Predicates (CPs). System achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively on two types of Bengali corpus."

The present task aims to manually annotate the sentences in a web based Bengali blog corpus with the emotional components such as emotional expression (word/phrase), intensity, associated holder and topic(s). Ekmanxe2x80x99s six emotion classes (anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad and surprise) along with three types of intensities (high, general and low) are considered for the sentence level annotation. Presence of discourse markers, punctuation marks, negations, conjuncts, reduplication, rhetoric knowledge and especially emoticons play the contributory roles in the annotation process. Different types of fixed and relaxed strategies have been employed to measure the agreement of the sentential emotions, intensities, emotional holders and topics respectively. Experimental results for each emotion class at word level on a small set of the whole corpus have been found satisfactory."
S10-1045,{JU}: A Supervised Approach to Identify Semantic Relations from Paired Nominals,2010,5,3,3,0.273973,13776,santanu pal,Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation,0,"This article presents the experiments carried out at Jadavpur University as part of the participation in Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nomi-nals in the SemEval 2010 exercise. Separate rules for each type of the relations are identified in the baseline model based on the verbs and prepositions present in the segment between each pair of nominals. Inclusion of WordNet features associated with the paired nominals play an important role in distinguishing the relations from each other. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) based machine-learning framework is adopted for classifying the pair of nominals. Application of dependency relations, Named Entities (NE) and various types of WordNet features along with several combinations of these features help to improve the performance of the system. Error analysis suggests that the performance can be improved by applying suitable strategies to differentiate each paired nominal in an already identified relation. Evaluation result gives an overall macro-averaged F1 score of 52.16%."

W09-3411,{B}engali Verb Subcategorization Frame Acquisition - A Baseline Model,2009,26,4,2,0,8790,somnath banerjee,Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on {A}sian Language Resources ({ALR}7),0,"Acquisition of verb subcategorization frames is important as verbs generally take different types of relevant arguments associated with each phrase in a sentence in comparison to other parts of speech categories. This paper presents the acquisition of different subcategorization frames for a Bengali verb Kara (do). It generates compound verbs in Bengali when combined with various noun phrases. The main hypothesis here is that the subcategorization frames for a Bengali verb are same with the subcategorization frames for its equivalent English verb with an identical sense tag. Syntax plays the main role in the acquisition of Bengali verb subcategorization frames. The output frames of the Bengali verbs have been compared with the frames of the equivalent English verbs identified using a Bengali-English bilingual lexicon. The flexible ordering of different phrases, additional attachment of optional phrases in Bengali sentences make this frames acquisition task challenging. This system has demonstrated precision and recall values of 77.11% and 88.23% respectively on a test set of 100 sentences."
