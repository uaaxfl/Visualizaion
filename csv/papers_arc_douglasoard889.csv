We introduce a general approach to these tasks motivated by syntopical reading, a reading process that emphasizes comparing and contrasting viewpoints in order to improve topic understanding. To capture collection-level context, we introduce the syntopical graph, a data structure for linking claims within a collection. A syntopical graph is a typed multi-graph where nodes represent claims and edges represent different possible pairwise relationships, such as entailment, paraphrase, or support. Experiments applying syntopical graphs to the problems of detecting stance and aspects demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in each domain, significantly outperforming approaches that do not utilize collection-level information."

It uses data augmentation and negative sampling techniques on noisy parallel sentence data to directly learn a cross-lingual embedding-based query relevance model. Results show that this approach performs as well as or better than multiple state-of-the-art machine translation + monolingual retrieval systems trained on the same parallel data. Moreover, when a rationale training secondary objective is applied to encourage the model to match word alignment hints from a phrase-based statistical machine translation model, consistent improvements are seen across three language pairs (English-Somali, English-Swahili and English-Tagalog) over a variety of state-of-the-art baselines."

There are, however, many situations where n-best lists are needed, yet there is no established way of evaluating them. This paper establishes a framework for addressing n-best evaluation by outlining three different questions one could consider when determining how one would define a {`}good{'} n-best list and proposing evaluation measures for each question. The first and principal contribution is an evaluation measure that characterizes the translation quality of an entire n-best list by asking whether many of the valid translations are placed near the top of the list. The second is a measure that uses gold translations with preference annotations to ask to what degree systems can produce ranked lists in preference order. The third is a measure that rewards partial matches, evaluating the closeness of the many items in an n-best list to a set of many valid references. These three perspectives make clear that having access to many references can be useful when n-best evaluation is the goal."

Where previous work on text segmentation considers the tasks of document segmentation and segment labeling separately, we show that the tasks contain complementary information and are best addressed jointly. We introduce Segment Pooling LSTM (S-LSTM), which is capable of jointly segmenting a document and labeling segments. In support of joint training, we develop a method for teaching the model to recover from errors by aligning the predicted and ground truth segments. We show that S-LSTM reduces segmentation error by 30{\%} on average, while also improving segment labeling."

That suggests a need for collection-specific approaches to entity linking, similar to those have proven successful for person mentions. This paper describes a process for automatically constructing such a collection-specific knowledge base of organization entities for named mentions in Enron. A new public test collection for linking 130 mentions of organizations found in Enron email to either Wikipedia or to this new collection-specific knowledge base is also described. Together, Wikipedia entities plus the new collectionspecific knowledge base cover 83% of the 130 organization mentions, a 14% (absolute) improvement over the 69% that could be linked to Wikipedia alone."

Recently, however, methods have been demonstrated for matching spoken terms to spoken content without the need for language-tuned transcription. This paper describes the first application of such techniques to ranked retrieval, evaluated using a newly created test collection. Both the queries and the collection to be searched are based on Gujarati produced naturally by native speakers; relevance assessment was performed by other native speakers of Gujarati. Ranked retrieval is based on fast acoustic matching that identifies a deeply nested set of matching speech regions, coupled with ways of combining evidence from those matching regions. Results indicate that the resulting ranked lists may be useful for some practical similarity-based ranking tasks."

Entity linking is a central step in knowledge base population. Current entity linking systems do not explicitly model the discourse context in which the communication occurs. Nevertheless, the notion of shared context is central to the linguistic theory of pragmatics and plays a crucial role in Grice's cooperative communication principle. Furthermore, modeling context facilitates joint resolution of entities, an important problem in entity linking yet to be addressed satisfactorily. This paper describes an approach to context-aware entity linking."

Three ways of incorporating such a preference into a hierarchical phrase-based MT model are proposed, and the approach where all three are combined yields the greatest improvements for both Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation experiments."

Name projections are then curated, again through crowdsourcing. This technique resulted in the first publicly available multilingual cross-language entity linking collection. The collection includes approximately 55,000 queries, comprising between 875 and 4,329 queries for each of twenty-one non-English languages."

This paper explores combination-of-evidence techniques using three types of statistical translation models: context-independent token translation, token translation using phrase-dependent contexts, and token translation using sentence-dependent contexts. Context-independent translation is performed using statistically-aligned tokens in parallel text, phrase-dependent translation is performed using aligned statistical phrases, and sentence-dependent translation is performed using those same aligned phrases together with an n-gram language model. Experiments on retrieval of Arabic, Chinese, and French documents using English queries show that no one technique is optimal for all queries, but that statistically significant improvements in mean average precision over strong baselines can be achieved by combining translation evidence from all three techniques. The optimal combination is, however, found to be resource-dependent, indicating a need for future work on robust tuning to the characteristics of individual collections."

Multiple alternate pronunciations, or degradations, of a query word's phoneme sequence are hypothesized and incorporated into the ranking function. We consider two methods for hypothesizing these degradations, the best of which is constructed using factored phrase-based statistical machine translation. We show that this approach is able to significantly improve upon a state-of-the-art baseline technique in an evaluation on held-out speech. We evaluate our systems using three different methods for indexing the speech utterances (using phoneme, phoneme multigram, and word recognition), and find that degradation modeling shows particular promise for locating out-of-vocabulary words when the underlying indexing system is constructed with standard word-based speech recognition."

Combining retrieval results from systems built on various errorful representations of the same collection offers some potential to address these challenges. This paper explores that potential by applying Generalized Additive Models to optimize the combination of ranked retrieval results obtained using transcripts produced automatically for the same spoken content by substantially different recognition systems. Topic-averaged retrieval effectiveness better than any previously reported for the same collection was obtained, and even larger gains are apparent when using an alternative measure emphasizing results on the most difficult topics."

The CLEF 2005 Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task provides a standard test collection to investigate these challenges. We show that we can improve retrieval performance: by careful selection of the term weighting scheme; by decomposing automated transcripts into phonetic substrings to help ameliorate transcription errors; and by combining automatic transcriptions with manually-assigned metadata. We further show that topic translation with online machine translation resources yields effective CL-SR.

These applications will then be used to illustrate the critical dependence on component technologies such as computational morphology, acquisition of translation knowledge from corpora, speaker identification, automatic speech recognition, and summarization. Information retrieval systems can offer a useful environment for extrinsic evaluation of new component capabilities, so the tutorial will conclude with a review of evaluation techniques that can help to reveal the contribution of specific components.

Our system accepts an entire English news story (text) as query, and retrieves relevant Chinese broadcast news stories (audio) from the document collection. Hence this is a cross-language and cross-media retrieval task. We applied a multi-scale approach to our problem, which unifies the use of phrases, words and subwords in retrieval. The English queries are translated into Chinese by means of a dictionary-based approach, where we have integrated phrase-based translation with word-by-word translation. Untranslatable named entities are transliterated by a novel subword translation technique. The multi-scale approach can be divided into three subtasks -- multi-scale query formulation, multi-scale audio indexing (by speech recognition) and multi-scale retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of phrase-based translation and subword translation gave performance gains, and multi-scale retrieval outperforms word-based retrieval."

We have implemented six query translation techniques that use bilingual term lists and one based on direct use of the translation output from an existing machine translation system; these are compared with a document translation technique that uses output from the same machine translation system. Average precision measures on a TREC collection suggest that arbitrarily selecting a single dictionary translation is typically no less effective than using every translation in the dictionary, that query translation using a machine translation system can achieve somewhat better effectiveness than simpler techniques, and that document translation may result in further improvements in retrieval effectiveness under some conditions."
