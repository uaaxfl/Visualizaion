2020.wmt-1.116,{BERGAMOT}-{LATTE} Submissions for the {WMT}20 Quality Estimation Shared Task,2020,-1,-1,6,0,2508,marina fomicheva,Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation,0,"This paper presents our submission to the WMT2020 Shared Task on Quality Estimation (QE). We participate in Task and Task 2 focusing on sentence-level prediction. We explore (a) a black-box approach to QE based on pre-trained representations; and (b) glass-box approaches that leverage various indicators that can be extracted from the neural MT systems. In addition to training a feature-based regression model using glass-box quality indicators, we also test whether they can be used to predict MT quality directly with no supervision. We assess our systems in a multi-lingual setting and show that both types of approaches generalise well across languages. Our black-box QE models tied for the winning submission in four out of seven language pairs inTask 1, thus demonstrating very strong performance. The glass-box approaches also performed competitively, representing a light-weight alternative to the neural-based models."
2020.tacl-1.35,Unsupervised Quality Estimation for Neural Machine Translation,2020,63,0,6,0,2508,marina fomicheva,Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,0,"Quality Estimation (QE) is an important component in making Machine Translation (MT) useful in real-world applications, as it is aimed to inform the user on the quality of the MT output at test time. Existing approaches require large amounts of expert annotated data, computation, and time for training. As an alternative, we devise an unsupervised approach to QE where no training or access to additional resources besides the MT system itself is required. Different from most of the current work that treats the MT system as a black box, we explore useful information that can be extracted from the MT system as a by-product of translation. By utilizing methods for uncertainty quantification, we achieve very good correlation with human judgments of quality, rivaling state-of-the-art supervised QE models. To evaluate our approach we collect the first dataset that enables work on both black-box and glass-box approaches to QE."

The task includes estimation at three granularity levels: word, sentence and document. A novel addition is evaluating sentence-level QE against human judgments: in other words, designing MT metrics that do not need a reference translation. This year we include three language pairs, produced solely by neural machine translation systems. Participating teams from eleven institutions submitted a variety of systems to different task variants and language pairs."

We build several baseline translation systems for both directions of the English-Estonian language pair using monolingual data only; the systems belong to the phrase-based unsupervised machine translation paradigm where we experimented with phrase lengths of up to 3. As a main contribution, we performed a set of standalone experiments with compositional phrase embeddings as a substitute for phrases as individual vocabulary entries. Results show that reasonable n-gram vectors can be obtained by simply summing up individual word vectors which retains or improves the performance of phrase-based unsupervised machine tranlation systems while avoiding limitations of atomic phrase vectors."

The proposed models use features based on attention weights of a neural machine translation system and cross-lingual phrase embeddings as input features of a regression model. Two of the proposed models require only a neural machine translation system with an attention mechanism with no additional resources. Results show that combining neural networks and baseline features leads to significant improvements over the baseline features alone.

This discourse unawareness can lead to incorrect translation of words or phrases that are ambiguous in the sentence. For example, the German term Typen in the phrase diese Typen can be translated either into English types or guys. However, knowing that it co-refers to the compound Kxc2xa8 (xe2x80x9cbody typesxe2x80x9d) in the previous sentence helps to disambiguate the term and translate it into types. We propose a method of automatically detecting document-level trigger words (like Kxc2xa8 orpertypen), whose presence helps to disambiguate translations of ambiguous terms. In this preliminary study we analyze the method and its limitations, and outline future work directions."

The occurrences are identified through pattern matching rules, which detect XY compounds followed closely by a potentially coreferent occurrence of Y , such as xe2x80x9cNordwand ... Wandxe2x80x9d. Two strategies are proposed to improve the translation of the second occurrence of Y : re-using the cached translation of Y from the XY compound, or post-editing the translation of Y using the head of the translation of XY . Experiments are performed on Chinese-toEnglish and German-to-French statistical machine translation, over the WIT3 and TextBerg corpora respectively, with 261 XY/Y pairs each. The results suggest that while the overall BLEU scores increase only slightly, the translations of the targeted polysemous nouns are significantly improved."

The work was carried out within the FP7 EU-funded project SUMAT and involved two rounds of evaluation: a quality evaluation and a measure of productivity gain/loss. We present the SMT systems built for the project and the corpora they were trained on, which combine professionally created and crowd-sourced data. Evaluation goals, methodology and results are presented for the eleven translation pairs that were evaluated by professional subtitlers. Overall, a majority of the machine translated subtitles received good quality ratings. The results were also positive in terms of productivity, with a global gain approaching 40{\%}. We also evaluated the impact of applying quality estimation and filtering of poor MT output, which resulted in higher productivity gains for filtered files as opposed to fully machine-translated files. Finally, we present and discuss feedback from the subtitlers who participated in the evaluation, a key aspect for any eventual adoption of machine translation technology in professional subtitling."

This data has the potential of being used for training domain-specific machine translation systems for corporate or even personal use. But while the resulting systems usually perform well in translating domain-specific language, their out-of-domain vocabulary coverage is often insufficient due to the limited size of the translation memories. In this paper, we demonstrate that small in-domain translation memories can be successfully complemented with freely available general-domain parallel corpora such that (a) the number of out-of-vocabulary words (OOV) is reduced while (b) the in-domain terminology is preserved. In our experiments, a Germanxe2x80x93French and a Germanxe2x80x93Italian statistical machine translation system geared to marketing texts of the automobile industry has been significantly improved using Europarl and OpenSubtitles data, both in terms of automatic evaluation metrics and human judgement."

The FP7 European project SUMAT (An Online Service for SUbtitling by MAchine Translation: http://www.sumat-project.eu) aims to develop an online subtitle translation service for nine European languages, combined into 14 different language pairs, in order to semi-automate the subtitle translation processes of both freelance translators and subtitling companies on a large scale. In this paper we discuss the data collection and parallel corpus compilation for training SMT systems, which includes several procedures such as data partition, conversion, formatting, normalization and alignment. We discuss in detail each data pre-processing step using various approaches. Apart from the quantity (around 1 million subtitles per language pair), the SUMAT corpus has a number of very important characteristics. First of all, high quality both in terms of translation and in terms of high-precision alignment of parallel documents and their contents has been achieved. Secondly, the contents are provided in one consistent format and encoding. Finally, additional information such as type of content in terms of genres and domain is available."

Here we show that not only do the sequential models result in the same or better translation quality, but even from the set of sequential alignment models simpler ones can match the performance of the HMM-based model, whereas using computationally less expensive and faster algorithms to train and align new sentence pairs.

The morphological analyzers we use are the unsupervised Morfessor morpheme segmentation and analyzer toolkit and the rule-based morphological analyzer T3. Our translations are done using the Moses statistical machine translation toolkit with training on the JRC-Acquis corpora and translating on Estonian to English and English to Estonian language directions. In our work we model such linguistic phenomena as word lemmas and endings and splitting compound words into simpler parts. Also lemma information was used to introduce new factors to the corpora and to use this information for better word alignment or for alternative path back-off translation. From the results we find that even though these methods have shown previously and keep showing promise of improved translation, their success still largely depends on the corpora and language pairs used."

The method takes into consideration slight differences in the source documents, different levels of segmentation of the input corpora, encoding differences and other aspects of the task. The paper describes two experiments conducted to test the method. In the first experiment, the Estonian-English part of the JRC-Acquis corpus was combined with another corpus of legislation texts.
