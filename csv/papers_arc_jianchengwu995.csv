The method involves automatically analyzing reference and learner corpora, extracting grammar patterns with example phrases, and computing dubious, overused patterns. At run-time, as the user types (or mouses over) a word, the system automatically retrieves and displays grammar patterns and examples, most relevant to the word. The user can opt for patterns from a general corpus, academic corpus, learner corpus, or commonly overused dubious patterns found in a learner corpus. WriteAhead proactively engages the user with steady, timely, and spot-on information for effective assisted writing. Preliminary experiments show that WriteAhead fulfills the design goal of fostering learner independence and encouraging self-editing, and is likely to induce better writing, and improve writing skills in the long run."

In our approach, potential typos in a given sentence are then corrected using a channel model and a character-based language model in the noisy channel model. In the training phase, we estimate the channel probabilities for each character based on ngrams in Web corpus. At run-time, the system generates correction candidates for each character in the given sentence and selects the appropriate correction using the channel model and the language model.

In our approach, we incorporate inverted file indexing, PoS information from BNC, and semantic indexing based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Google Web 1T. The method involves parsing the query to transforming it into several keyword retrieval commands. Word chunks are retrieved with counts, further filtering the chunks with the query as a RE, and finally displaying the results according to the counts, similarities, and topics. Clusters of synonyms or conceptually related words are also provided. In addition, Linggle provides example sentences from The New York Times on demand. The current implementation of Linggle is the most functionally comprehensive, and is in principle language and dataset independent. We plan to extend Linggle to provide fast and convenient access to a wealth of linguistic information embodied in Web scale datasets including Google Web 1T and Google Books Ngram for many major languages in the world."

The second model is a back-off model, used in the case where the trigram is not found in the training data. At run-time, the phrases in the input are matched and translated, and ranking is performed on all possible translations to produce a corrected sentence as output. Evaluation on a set of sentences in a learner corpus shows that the method corrects serial errors reasonably well. Our methodology exploits the state-of-the art in machine translation, resulting in an effective system that can deal with many error types at the same time."

Evidently, automatic grammar checkers are much needed to help learners improve their writing. However, typical English proofreading tools do not target specifically the most common errors made by second language learners. The grammar checkers available in popular word processors have been developed with a focus on native speaker errors such as subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. Therefore, these word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) often offer little or no help with common errors causing problems for English learners. Grammatical Error Detection (GED) for language learners has been an area of active research. GED involves pinpointing some words in a given sentence as grammatically erroneous and possibly offering correction. Common errors in learnersxe2x80x99 writing include missing, unnecessary, and misuse of articles, prepositions, noun number, and verb form.
