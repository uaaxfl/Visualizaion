The only option to enable and to benefit from multilingualism is through Language Technologies (LT), i.e., Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies. We describe the European Language Grid (ELG), which is targeted to evolve into the primary platform and marketplace for LT in Europe by providing one umbrella platform for the European LT landscape, including research and industry, enabling all stakeholders to upload, share and distribute their services, products and resources. At the end of our EU project, which will establish a legal entity in 2022, the ELG will provide access to approx. 1300 services for all European languages as well as thousands of data sets."

However, language barriers impacting business, cross-lingual and cross-cultural communication are still omnipresent. Language Technologies (LTs) are a powerful means to break down these barriers. While the last decade has seen various initiatives that created a multitude of approaches and technologies tailored to Europe{'}s specific needs, there is still an immense level of fragmentation. At the same time, AI has become an increasingly important concept in the European Information and Communication Technology area. For a few years now, AI {--} including many opportunities, synergies but also misconceptions {--} has been overshadowing every other topic. We present an overview of the European LT landscape, describing funding programmes, activities, actions and challenges in the different countries with regard to LT, including the current state of play in industry and the LT market. We present a brief overview of the main LT-related activities on the EU level in the last ten years and develop strategic guidance with regard to four key dimensions."

European LT business is dominated by hundreds of SMEs and a few large players. Many are world-class, with technologies that outperform the global players. However, European LT business is also fragmented {--} by nation states, languages, verticals and sectors, significantly holding back its impact. The European Language Grid (ELG) project addresses this fragmentation by establishing the ELG as the primary platform for LT in Europe. The ELG is a scalable cloud platform, providing, in an easy-to-integrate way, access to hundreds of commercial and non-commercial LTs for all European languages, including running tools and services as well as data sets and resources. Once fully operational, it will enable the commercial and non-commercial European LT community to deposit and upload their technologies and data sets into the ELG, to deploy them through the grid, and to connect with other resources. The ELG will boost the Multilingual Digital Single Market towards a thriving European LT community, creating new jobs and opportunities. Furthermore, the ELG project organises two open calls for up to 20 pilot projects. It also sets up 32 national competence centres and the European LT Council for outreach and coordination purposes."

Up to March 2016, 2100 Language Resources were allocated an ISLRN number, not only ELRA{'}s and LDC{'}s catalogued Language Resources, but also the ones from other important organisations like the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the Resource Management Agency (RMA) who expressed their strong support to this initiative.In the research field, not only assigning a unique identification number is important, but also referring to a Language Resource as an object \textit{per se} (like publications) has now become an obvious requirement. The ISLRN could also become an important parameter to be considered to compute a Language Resource Impact Factor (LRIF) in order to recognize the merits of the producers of Language Resources. Integrating the ISLRN number into a LR-oriented bibliographical reference is thus part of the objective. The idea is to make use of a BibTeX entry that would take into account Language Resources items, including ISLRN.The ISLRN being a requested field within the LREC 2016 submission, we expect that several other LRs will be allocated an ISLRN number by the conference date. With this expansion, this number aims to be a spreadly-used LR citation instrument within works referring to LRs."

In this sense, it firstly proposes a typology of e-commerce static and dynamic textual genres and it identifies those that may be more successfully targeted by SMT. The specific challenges concerning the automatic translation of user-generated content are discussed in detail. Secondly, the paper highlights the risk of data sparsity inherent to e-commerce and it explores the state-of-the-art strategies to achieve domain adequacy via adaptation. Thirdly, it proposes a robust workflow for the development of SMT systems adapted to the e-commerce domain by relying on inexpensive methods. Given the scarcity of user-generated language corpora for most language pairs, the paper proposes to obtain monolingual target-language data to train language models and aligned parallel corpora to tune and evaluate MT systems by means of crowdsourcing."

META-SHARE is a network of repositories that store language resources (data, tools and processing services) documented with high-quality metadata, aggregated in central inventories allowing for uniform search and access. META-SHARE was developed by META-NET (www.meta-net.eu) and aims to serve as an important component of a language technology marketplace for researchers, developers, professionals and industrial players, catering for the full development cycle of language technology, from research through to innovative products and services. The observed usage in its initial steps, the steadily increasing number of network nodes, resources, users, queries, views and downloads are all encouraging and considered as supportive of the choices made so far. In tandem, take-up activities like direct linking and processing of datasets by language processing services as well as metadata transformation to RDF are expected to open new avenues for data and resources linking and boost the organic growth of the infrastructure while facilitating language technology deployment by much wider research communities and industrial sectors."

MEDAR will be updating the surveys and BLARK for Arabic already made, and will then focus on machine translation (and other tools for translation) and information retrieval with a focus on language resources, tools and evaluation for these applications. A very important part of the MEDAR project is to reinforce and extend the NEMLAR network and to create a cooperation roadmap for Human Language Technologies for Arabic. It is expected that the cooperation roadmap will attract wide attention from other parties and that it can help create a larger platform for collaborative projects. Finally, the project will focus on dissemination of knowledge about existing resources and tools, as well as actors and activities; this will happen through newsletter, website and an international conference which will follow up on the Cairo conference of 2004. Dissemination to user communities will also be important, e.g. through participation in translators? conferences. The goal of these activities is to create a stronger and lasting collaboration between EU countries and Arabic speaking countries."

Sampling criteria are defined in a corpus design scheme. C-ORAL-ROM adopts two different sampling strategies, one for the formal and one for the informal part: While a set of typical domains of application is selected to document the formal use of language, the informal part documents speech variation using parameters referring to the event{'}s structure (dialogue vs. monologue) and the sociological domain of use (family-private vs public). The four romance corpora are tagged with respect to terminal and non terminal prosodic breaks. Terminal breaks are assumed to be the more relevant cues for the identification of relevant linguistic domains in spontaneous speech (utterances). Relations with other concurrent criteria are discussed. The multimedia storage of the C-ORAL-ROM corpus is based on this principle; each textual string ending with a terminal break is aligned, through the Win Pitch speech software, to its acoustic counterpart, generating the data base of all utterances."

LRs are a central component of the so-called xe2x80x9clinguistic infrastructurexe2x80x9d (the other key element being Evaluation), necessary for the development of any Human Language Technology (HLT) application. They play a critical role, as horizontal technology, in different emerging areas of FP6, and have been recognized as a priority within a number of national projects around Europe and world-wide.

This is going to be even more true in the new Europe with 25 languages on a par. Introduction After considering the strategic and infrastructural role of Language Resources (LRs) within any Human Language Technology (HLT) application (section 1), we focus on the main issues discussed within the ENABLER (European National Activities for Basic Language Resources) Thematic Network (section 2): the survey of LRs, interoperability and multilinguality, open access to LRs, validation methodologies for LRs, industrial and basic requirements. Finally, few recommendations are provided towards the design of general strategies and an overall coordination for the field of LRs (section 3). 1. The Strategic Role of LRs Language Resources (LRs) xe2x80x93 Written, Spoken and, recently, Multimodal xe2x80x93 are a central and strategic component of the so-called xe2x80x9clinguistic infrastructurexe2x80x9d (the other key element being Evaluation), necessary for the development of any Human Language Technology (HLT) application and product. The availability of adequate LRs for as many languages as possible is a pre-requisite for the development of a truly multilingual Information Society. They play a critical role, as horizontal technology, in different areas of the 6 Framework Programme, and have been recognized as a priority within a number of national projects around Europe. The availability of LRs is also a xe2x80x9csensitivexe2x80x9d issue, touching directly the sphere of linguistic and cultural identity, but also with economical, societal and political implications. This is going to be even more true in the new Europe with 25 languages on a par. The ENABLER Thematic Network of HLT National Projects in European countries xe2x80x93 an EC funded IST project, designed and started by Antonio Zampolli, with a clear strategic vision for the field of LRs xe2x80x93 is the first broad European initiative which has the mission of explicitly considering together the technical, organizational, strategic and political issues of LRs. In ENABLER these various aspects are put together in a coherent framework, to set up mediumand long-term set of priorities (both technical and strategic) and to promote these at the national and international levels. Moreover, ENABLER has recognized the importance to promote actions aiming at integrating the different resource types, until now developed independently, and xe2x80x93 as a consequence xe2x80x93 at promoting the cooperation between the communities of Speech, Text and Multimodality. In the following we briefly highlight the main issues tackled by ENABLER on the different layers. 2. The Main Issues 2.1. The Survey of LRs The ENABLER Consortium conducted the Survey of LRs to get a global picture of the situation on LRs, in order to be able to compare the various conditions that hold across different languages and xe2x80x93 on this basis xe2x80x93 to suggest more"

Other partners are ELDA (France), IBM (Germany), NSC (Israel), Siemens (Germany), Lucent (UK), Knowledge, the University of Patras (both Greece) and UPC (Spain), plus SPEX (the Netherlands) as validation agency. Now that OrienTel has passed the finish line, the present paper gives an update of the design conventions, and an account of the projectxe2x80x99s achievements. The paper also illustrates some of the challenges that the consortium faced which are mostly related to the validation and the research subjects. Countries and technologies The OrienTel area, ranging from the Gulf States in the East to Morocco in the West, is a very heterogeneous region. Its purchasing power in terms of GDP ranges from the UAE's US$ 16,800 to Yemen's US$ 304, technological infrastructure from Yemen's 1.4% fixed line teledensity to Cyprus' 54%. The number of mobile subscribers to mobile telephony networks stretches from virtually zero in Syria to close to 8 million in Egypt (CIT Publications, 2000). When OrienTel started in 2001, the consortium, consisting of ScanSoft (Belgium, Germany), ELDA (France), IBM (Germany, Egypt), NSC (Israel), Knowledge (Greece), Siemens (Germany), Lucent (UK) and the Universities of Patras (Greece) and UPC Barcelona (Spain), expected high growth rates particularly in the mobile part of the business. The database structure was therefore designed to meet the objectives of mobile speech applications via the telephone. By the end of the project, Arabic countries have surpassed the 30 million subscriber mark for mobile services, with an annual growth rate of 9.92%. For the first time the Arab countries have more subscribers to mobile services than to fixed lines. As 70% of all speakers were recorded via mobile networks, the OrienTel consortium is well equipped to meet the challenges the region poses."
