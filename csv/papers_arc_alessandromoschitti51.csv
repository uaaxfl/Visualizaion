However, these cannot exploit the representation learning ability of neural networks, which would make supervised clustering even more powerful, i.e., general clustering patterns can be learned automatically. In this paper, we design neural networks based on latent structured prediction loss and Transformer models to approach supervised clustering. We tested our methods on the task of automatically recreating categories of intents from publicly available question intent corpora. The results show that our approach delivers 95.65{\%} of F1, outperforming the state of the art by 17.24{\%}."

AVA uses Transformer-based language models to encode question, answer, and reference texts. This allows for effectively assessing answer correctness using similarity between the reference and an automatic answer, biased towards the question semantics. To design, train, and test AVA, we built multiple large training, development, and test sets on public and industrial benchmarks. Our innovative solutions achieve up to 74.7{\%} F1 score in predicting human judgment for single answers. Additionally, AVA can be used to evaluate the overall system Accuracy with an error lower than 7{\%} at 95{\%} of confidence when measured on several QA systems."

We evaluated the quality of the RWS-derived data by training TANDA models, which are the state of the art for AS2. Our results show that the data consistently bolsters TANDA on three different datasets. In particular, we set the new state of the art for AS2 to P@1=90.1{\%}, and MAP=92.9{\%}, on WikiQA. We record similar performance gains of RWS on a much larger dataset named Web-based Question Answering (WQA)."

Question Filtering via Answer Model Distillation for Efficient Question Answering,2021,-1,-1,2,0,9821,siddhant garg,Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,0,"In this paper we propose a novel approach towards improving the efficiency of Question Answering (QA) systems by filtering out questions that will not be answered by them. This is based on an interesting new finding: the answer confidence scores of state-of-the-art QA systems can be approximated well by models solely using the input question text. This enables preemptive filtering of questions that are not answered by the system due to their answer confidence scores being lower than the system threshold. Specifically, we learn Transformer-based question models by distilling Transformer-based answering models. Our experiments on three popular QA datasets and one industrial QA benchmark demonstrate the ability of our question models to approximate the Precision/Recall curves of the target QA system well. These question models, when used as filters, can effectively trade off lower computation cost of QA systems for lower Recall, e.g., reducing computation by {\textasciitilde}60{\%}, while only losing {\textasciitilde}3-4{\%} of Recall."

In contrast, more computationally expensive models designed for machine reading comprehension tasks typically receive one or more passages as input, which often results in better accuracy. In this work, we present an approach to efficiently incorporate contextual information in AS2 models. For each answer candidate, we first use unsupervised similarity techniques to extract relevant sentences from its source document, which we then feed into an efficient transformer architecture fine-tuned for AS2. Our best approach, which leverages a multi-way attention architecture to efficiently encode context, improves 6{\%} to 11{\%} over non-contextual state of the art in AS2 with minimal impact on system latency.

In this paper, we introduce the Cascade Transformer, a simple yet effective technique to adapt transformer-based models into a cascade of rankers. Each ranker is used to prune a subset of candidates in a batch, thus dramatically increasing throughput at inference time. Partial encodings from the transformer model are shared among rerankers, providing further speed-up.

To capture meaningful interactions between the argument, predicate, their syntactic path and the corresponding role label, we compress each feature representation first to a lower dimensional space prior to assessing their interactions. This corresponds to using an overall cross-product feature representation and maintaining associated parameters as a four-way low-rank tensor. The tensor parameters are optimized for the SRL performance using standard online algorithms. Our tensor-based approach rivals the best performing system on the CoNLL-2009 shared task. In addition, we demonstrate that adding the representation tensor to a competitive tensorfree model yields 2% absolute increase in Fscore. 1"

This article describes a set of experiments that demonstrate that relational features, mainly derived from dependency-syntactic and semantic role structures, can significantly improve the performance of automatic systems for a number of fine-grained opinion analysis tasks: marking up opinion expressions, finding opinion holders, and determining the polarities of opinion expressions. These features make it possible to model the way opinions expressed in natural-language discourse interact in a sentence over arbitrary distances. The use of relations requires us to consider multiple opinions simultaneously, which makes the search for the optimal analysis intractable. However, a reranker can be used as a sufficiently accurate and efficient approximation. A number of feature sets and machine learning approaches for the rerankers are evaluated. For the task of opinion expression extraction, the best model shows a 10-point absolute improvement in soft recall on the MPQA corpus over a conventional sequence labeler based on local contextual features, while precision decreases only slightly. Significant improvements are also seen for the extended tasks where holders and polarities are considered: 10 and 7 points in recall, respectively. In addition, the systems outperform previously published results for unlabeled (6 F-measure points) and polarity-labeled (10xe2x80x9315 points) opinion expression extraction. Finally, as an extrinsic evaluation, the extracted MPQA-style opinion expressions are used in practical opinion mining tasks.

Results on two data sets xe2x80x93 Machine Reading and TimeBank xe2x80x93 with 3-fold crossvalidation show that the combination of traditional feature vectors and the new structural features improves on the state of the art for inter-sentence TERE by about 20%, achieving a 30.2 F1 score on intersentence TERE alone, and 47.2 F1 for all TERE (inter and intra sentence combined)."

We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering."

It was a follow-on to the English-only task organized in 2011. Until the creation of the OntoNotes corpus, resources in this subfield of language processing have tended to be limited to noun phrase coreference, often on a restricted set of entities, such as ACE entities. OntoNotes provides a large-scale corpus of general anaphoric coreference not restricted to noun phrases or to a specified set of entity types and covering multiple languages. OntoNotes also provides additional layers of integrated annotation, capturing additional shallow semantic structure. This paper briefly describes the OntoNotes annotation (coreference and other layers) and then describes the parameters of the shared task including the format, pre-processing information, evaluation criteria, and presents and discusses the results achieved by the participating systems. Being a task that has a complex evaluation history, and multiple evalation conditions, it has, in the past, been difficult to judge the improvement in new algorithms over previously reported results. Having a standard test set and evaluation parameters, all based on a resource that provides multiple integrated annotation layers (parses, semantic roles, word senses, named entities and coreference) that could support joint models, should help to energize ongoing research in the task of entity and event coreference."

These tasks often require the processing of structured input, e.g., the ability to extract salient features from syntactic/semantic structures is critical to many NLP systems. Mapping such structured data into explicit feature vectors for ML algorithms requires large expertise, intuition and deep knowledge about the target linguistic phenomena. Kernel Methods (KM) are powerful ML tools (see e.g., (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004)), which can alleviate the data representation problem. They substitute feature-based similarities with similarity functions, i.e., kernels, directly defined between training/test instances, e.g., syntactic trees. Hence feature vectors are not needed any longer. Additionally, kernel engineering, i.e., the composition or adaptation of several prototype kernels, facilitates the design of effective similarities required for new tasks, e.g., (Moschitti, 2004; Moschitti, 2008)."

We exploit the DB structure to generate a set of candidate SQL queries, which we rerank with an SVM-ranker based on tree kernels. In particular, in the generation phase, we use (i) lexical dependencies in the question and (ii) the DB metadata, to build a set of plausible SELECT, WHERE and FROM clauses enriched with meaningful joins. We combine the clauses by means of rules and a heuristic weighting scheme, which allows for generating a ranked list of candidate SQL queries. This approach can be recursively applied to deal with complex questions, requiring nested SELECT instructions. Finally, we apply the reranker to reorder the list of question and SQL candidate pairs, whose members are represented as syntactic trees. The F1 of our model derived on standard benchmarks, 87% on the first question, is in line with the best models using external and expensive hand-crafted resources such as the question meaning interpretation. Moreover, our system shows a Recall of the correct answer of about 94% and 98% on the first 2 and 5 candidates, respectively. This is an interesting outcome considering that we only need pairs of questions and answers concerning a target DB (no SQL query is needed) to train our model."

We present BART, a highly modular toolkit for developing coreference applications. In the Johns Hopkins workshop on using lexical and encyclopedic knowledge for entity disambiguation, the toolkit was used to extend a reimplementation of Soon et al.Âs proposal with a variety of additional syntactic and knowledge-based features, and experiment with alternative resolution processes, preprocessing tools, and classifiers.

J08-2003,Tree Kernels for Semantic Role Labeling,2008,42,142,1,1,4033,alessandro moschitti,Computational Linguistics,0,"The availability of large scale data sets of manually annotated predicate-argument structures has recently favored the use of machine learning approaches to the design of automated semantic role labeling (SRL) systems. The main research in this area relates to the design choices for feature representation and for effective decompositions of the task in different learning models. Regarding the former choice, structural properties of full syntactic parses are largely employed as they represent ways to encode different principles suggested by the linking theory between syntax and semantics. The latter choice relates to several learning schemes over global views of the parses. For example, re-ranking stages operating over alternative predicate-argument sequences of the same sentence have shown to be very effective.n n In this article, we propose several kernel functions to model parse tree properties in kernel-based machines, for example, perceptrons or support vector machines. In particular, we define different kinds of tree kernels as general approaches to feature engineering in SRL. Moreover, we extensively experiment with such kernels to investigate their contribution to individual stages of an SRL architecture both in isolation and in combination with other traditional manually coded features. The results for boundary recognition, classification, and re-ranking stages provide systematic evidence about the significant impact of tree kernels on the overall accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is small. As a conclusive result, tree kernels allow for a general and easily portable feature engineering method which is applicable to a large family of natural language processing tasks."

Kernel functions appear to be a promising candidate to capture structure-sensitive similarities and complex feature combinations, but care is required to ensure they are exploited in the best possible fashion. In this paper we propose kernel functions for three subtasks of coreference resolution - binding constraint detection, expletive identification, and aliasing - together with an architecture to integrate them within the standard framework for coreference resolution."

Experiments on the PropBank data show that both classification and re-ranking based on tree kernels can improve SRL systems."

In case of factoid questions, we can use a question classifier (trained according to a target taxonomy) and a named entity recognizer. Unfortunately, this latter cannot be applied to generate answers related to non-factoid questions. In this paper, we tackle such problem by designing classifiers of non-factoid answers. As the feature design for this learning task is very complex, we take advantage of tree kernels to generate large feature set from the syntactic parse trees of passages relevant to the target question. Such kernels encode syntactic and lexical information in Support Vector Machines which can decide if a sentence focuses on a target taxonomy subject. The experiments with SVMs on the TREC 10 dataset show that our approach is an interesting future research."

The experiments with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) confirm a strong link between the SCF and the semantics of the verbal predicates as well as the benefit of using kernels in diverse and complex test conditions, e.g. classification of unseen verbs."
