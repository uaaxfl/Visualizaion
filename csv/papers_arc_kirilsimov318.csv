In this paper, we describe our efforts in manually aligning monolingual dictionaries. The alignment is carried out at sense-level for various resources in 15 languages. Moreover, senses are annotated with possible semantic relationships such as broadness, narrowness, relatedness, and equivalence. In comparison to previous datasets for this task, this dataset covers a wide range of languages and resources and focuses on the more challenging task of linking general-purpose language. We believe that our data will pave the way for further advances in alignment and evaluation of word senses by creating new solutions, particularly those notoriously requiring data such as neural networks. Our resources are publicly available at https://github.com/elexis-eu/MWSA."

The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that the previously proposed knowledge bases organize linguistic and world knowledge suboptimally for the task of word sense disambiguation. In doing so, the paper also establishes a new state of the art for knowledge-based approaches. Its best models are competitive in the broader context of supervised systems as well."

While previous work has focused on learning from raw word input, using word and character embeddings only, we show that for morphologically rich languages, such as Bulgarian, access to POS information contributes more to the performance gains than the detailed morphological information. Thus, we show that named entity recognition needs only coarse-grained POS tags, but at the same time it can benefit from simultaneously using some POS information of different granularity. Our evaluation results over a standard dataset show sizeable improvements over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian NER."

Integration of linguistically sound grammars, sophisticated machine learning settings and world knowledge background is possible given the availability of the appropriate resources: deep multilingual treebanks, representing detailed syntactic and semantic information; and vast quantities of world knowledge information encoded within ontologies and Linked Open Data datasets (LOD). Thus, the addition of world knowledge facts provides a substantial extension of the traditional semantic resources like WordNet, FrameNet and others. This extension comprises numerous types of Named Entities (Persons, Locations, Events, etc.), their properties (Person has a birthDate; birthPlace, etc.), relations between them (Person works for an Organization), events in which they participated (Person participated in war, etc.), and many other facts. This huge amount of structured knowledge can be considered the missing ingredient of the knowledgebased NLP of 80xe2x80x99s and the beginning of 90xe2x80x99s. The integration of world knowledge within language technology is defined as an ontology-to-text relation comprising different language and world knowledge in a common model. We assume that the lexicon is based on the ontology, i.e. the word senses are represented by concepts, relations or instances. The problem of lexical gaps is solved by allowing the storage of not only lexica, but also free phrases. The gaps in the ontology (a missing concept for a word sense) are solved by appropriate extensions of the ontology. The mapping is partial in the sense that both elements (the lexicon and the ontology) are artefacts and thus xe2x80x94 they are never complete. The integration of the interlinked ontology and lexicon with the grammar theory, on the other hand, requires some additional and non-trivial reasoning over the world knowledge. We will discuss phenomena like selectional constraints, metonymy, regular polysemy, bridging relations, which live in the intersective areas between world facts and their language reflection. Thus, the actual text annotation on the basis of ontology-to-text relation requires the explication of additional knowledge like co-occurrence of conceptual information, discourse structure, etc. Such knowledge is mainly present in deeply processed language resources like HPSG-based (LFG-based) treebanks (RedWoods treebank, DeepBank, and others). The inherent characteristics of these language resources is their dynamic nature. They are constructed simultaneously with the development of a deep grammar in the corresponding linguistic formalism. The grammar is used to produce all potential analyses of the sentences within the treebank. The correct analyses are selected manually on the base of linguistic discriminators which would determine the correct linguistic production. The annotation process of the sentences provides feedback for the grammar writer to update the grammar. The life cycle of a dynamic language resource can be naturally supported by the semantic technology behind the ontology and LOD modeling the grammatical knowledge as well as the annotation knowledge; supporting the annotation process; reclassification after changes within the grammar; querying the available resources; exploitation in real applications. The addition of a LOD component to the system would facilitate the exchange of language resources created in this way and would support the access to the existing resources on the web."

The challenge is to enhance relations among concepts instead of text entities, the latter pursued in most works. Our ultimate goal is to exploit these additional chains for concept disambiguation as well as sparseness resolution at concept level. First, a gold standard was prepared with manually connected links among concepts, anaphoric pronouns and contextual equivalents. This step was necessary not only for test purposes, but also for better orientation in the co-referent types and distribution. Then, two automatic systems were tested on the gold standard. Note that these systems were not designed specially for concept chaining.

The underlying idea behind the ontology-based lexicon is its organization via two semantic relations - equivalence and subsumption. These relations reflect the distribution of lexical unit senses with respect to the concepts in the ontology. The lexical unit candidates for concept mapping have been selected from two large and well-developed lexical resources for Bulgarian - a machine readable explanatory dictionary and a morphological lexicon. In the initial step, the lexical units were handled that have equivalent senses to the concepts in the ontology (2500 at the moment). Then, in the second stage, we are proceeding with lexical units selected on their frequency distribution in a large Bulgarian corpus.

The evaluation results show an F1 score of 92.54% for the sentence splitter, 98.49% for the tokenizer, 94.43% for the part-of-speech tagger, 84.60% for the chunker, and 77.56% for the syntactic parser, which should be interpreted as baseline for Bulgarian."

This simple user interface, which incorporates advanced search mechanisms, also offers innovative accessibility for visually impaired Greek and Bulgarian users. The rationale behind the work (and the relative resource) was to promote the comparative study of the cultural heritage of the two countries."

We combine well-established features used for other languages with language-specific lexical, syntactic and morphological information. In particular, we make use of the rich tagset annotation of the BulTreeBank (680 morpho-syntactic tags), from which we derive suitable task-specific tagsets (local and nonlocal). We further add domain-specific gazetteers and additional unlabeled data, achieving F1=89.4%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art results for English."
osenova-etal-2008-language,Language Resources for Semantic Document Annotation and Crosslingual Retrieval,2008,-1,-1,2,1,12058,petya osenova,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'08),0,"This paper describes the interaction among language resources for an adequate concept annotation of domain texts in several languages. The architecture includes domain ontology, domain texts, language specific lexicons, regular grammars and disambiguation rules. Ontology plays a central role in the architecture. We assume that it represents the meaning of the terms in the lexicons. Thus, the lexicons for the languages of the project (http://www.lt4el.eu/ - the LT4eL (Language Technology for eLearning) project is supported by the European Community under the Information Society and Media Directorate, Learning and Cultural Heritage Unit.) are constructed on the base of the ontology. The grammars and disambiguation rules facilitate the annotation of the text with concepts from the ontology. The established in this way relation between ontology and text supports different searches for content in the annotated documents. This is considered the preparatory phase for the integration of a semantic search facility in Learning Management Systems. The implementation and performance of this search are discussed in the context of related work as well as other types of searches. Also the results from some preliminary steps towards evaluation of the concept-based and text-based search are presented."

The extraction is performed by regular grammars over XML-encoded morphosyntactically-annotated documents. The results are less than satisfying and we claim that the reason for that is the intrinsic difficulty of the task, as measured by the low interannotator agreement, which calls for more sophisticated deeper linguistic processing, as well as for the use of machine learning classification techniques."

Our goal is to construct the next layer of linguistic interpretation over the morphological and syntactic layers that have already been encoded in the treebank. The annotation is called shallow because it encodes only the senses for the non-functional words and the relations between the semantic indices connected to them. We do not encode quantifiers and scope information. An ontology is employed as a stock of the concepts and relations that form the word senses. Our lexicon is based on the Generative Lexicon (GL) model (Pustejovsky 1995) as it was implemented in the SIMPLE project (Lenci et. al. 2000). GL defines the way in which the words are connected to the concepts and the relations in the ontology. Also it provides mechanisms for literal sense changes like type-coercion, metonymy, and similar. Some of these phenomena are presented in the annotation."

Additionally, the system is equipped with a macro language which allows the creation of tools sequences. The macro language includes a set of control operators for guiding the application of the tools in the macro. Usually, a tool or a macro works over a single document changing it or producing a new document. In some cases processing of more than one document is necessary xe2x80x94 in iterative statistics for treebank transformation, stand-off annotation, etc. For such processing the macro language allows a dynamic change of the processed documents."

We focus on the treebanking task as a trigger for basic language resources compilation. Two strategies have been applied in this respect: (1) implementing the main pre-processing modules before the treebank compilation and (2) creating more elaborate types of resources in parallel to the treebank compilation. The description of language resources within BulTreeBank project is divided into two parts: language technology, which includes tokenization, morphosyntactic analyzer, morphosyntactic disambiguation, partial grammars, and language data, which includes the layers of the BulTreeBank corpus and the variety of lexicons. The advantages of our approach to a less-spoken language (like Bulgarian) are as follows: it triggers the creation of the basic set of language resources which lack for certain languages and it rises the question about the ways of language resources creation."
ule-simov-2004-unexpected,Unexpected Productions May Well be Errors,2004,3,15,2,0,52175,tylman ule,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}{'}04),0,"We present a method for detecting annotation errors in treebanks. It assumes that errors are unexpected small tree fragments. We generate statistics over configurations of these fragments using a standard statistical test. We use the test result and the characteristics of their distributions as features to classify unseen configurations as likely errors via machine learning. Evaluation shows that the resulting list of error candidates is reliable, independent of corpus size, annotation quality, and target language. Setting up language resources involves considerable effort, because human intervention is inevitable and costly. Human annotators are essential, because they usually outperform automatic methods in terms of annotation accuracy, but they still make their own kind of errors. In addition to genuine mistakes, they do not always behave identically each time when presented with the same infrequent problem. Thus one can expect a number of errors to be present in any hand-built language resource. We divide these errors into the following categories: violations of the annotation guidelines and violations of language principles not covered by the annotation guidelines. Additionally, following Blaheta (2002), errors can also be: detectable xe2x80x93 errors that are easy to spot and fix by using queries over the annotation that define impossible configurations and transformations for correction; fixable xe2x80x93 errors which can be found automatically, but that require human intervention for correction; systematic inconsistencies xe2x80x93 errors which are not covered by the annotation guidelines, or errors not described precisely enough in the guidelines. These two classifications of errors in annotated corpora are orthogonal, but not independent: we can expect errors that are violations of the annotation guidelines to be usually detectable and fixable, and those that are a violation of language principles, but not covered by the annotation guidelines, to be more frequently systematic inconsistencies. Each class of errors requires a specific way for detection and correction. Detectable errors covered by the guidelines are the easiest in this respect. They can be addressed by encoding the guidelines in a formal way and by testing the corpus for consistency. Detecting the other types of errors requires additional linguistic knowledge. Such knowledge is not always available or easy to acquire, so that other mechanisms are desirable for error detection. We divide those methods into symbolic and non-symbolic approaches. The symbolic approaches are based on (linguistically motivated) pattern matching selecting possible deviations from linguistically correct occurrences. Patterns can be devised by human annotators, or they can be extracted (semi-)automatically from the corpus itself. The non-symbolic approaches use statistical methods to find rare events in the annotated corpus, where an event is a certain fragment of the annotation. In general, these methods can find errors in each of the above categories, but they are especially useful when pattern-based approaches are not easily applicable, because patterns are difficult to find. We present such a non-symbolic method that attacks errors and inconsistencies in structural annotation, and that shows good performance across languages and annotation schemes. We detect errors and inconsistencies that appear as unexpected events in a corpus using a variant of Directed Treebank Refinement (DTR; Ule, 2003) on artificially introduced errors and apply machine learning (ML) to produce fully automatically a list of likely error candidates."

The parser is used to support the annotation process in the BulTreeBank project. Thus the parser annotates only the xe2x80x98surexe2x80x99 cases. To maximize the number of the analyzed phrases the parser applies a set of grammars in a dynamic fashion. Each grammar determines not only the constituent structure (plus some syntactic dependencies internal to the structure), but also a description of the local and global context of the recognized phrase. The grammars available to the parser are arranged in a network. The order of the grammars application depends on the initial ordering in the network and the descriptions associated with the grammars. Thus the traverse is not deterministic. Additionally, the application of the grammars can be interleaved with the applications of other XML tools like remove, insert and transform operations. This architecture provides a flexible means for guiding the linguistic analysis in order to utilize all the available linguistic knowledge and to produce a very accurate partial analysis."

Standardisation adds to the interchange potential of the resources, making it easier to develop multilingual applications or to evaluate language technology tools across several languages. The process of the harmonisation of morphosyntactic categories, esp. for morphologically rich Slavic languages is also interesting from a language-typological perspective. The EU Multext-East project developed corpora, lexica and tools for seven languages, with the focus being on morphosyntactic data, including formal, EAGLES-based specifications for lexical morphosyntactic descriptions. The specifications were later extended, so that they currently cover nine languages, five from the Slavic family: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Serbian and Slovene. The paper presents these morphosyntactic specifications, giving their background and structure, including the encoding of the tables as TEI feature structures. The five Slavic language specifications are discussed in more depth."
