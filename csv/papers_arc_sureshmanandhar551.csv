In contrast to existing approaches to morphology learning, our method allows learning hierarchical organization of word morphology as a collection of tree structured paradigms. The model is fully unsupervised and based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process. Tree hierarchies are learned along with the corresponding morphological paradigms simultaneously. Our model is evaluated on Morpho Challenge and shows competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised morphological segmentation systems. Although we apply this model for morphological segmentation, the model itself can also be used for hierarchical clustering of other types of data."

The algorithm aims to capture allomorphs and homophonous morphemes for a deeper analysis of segmentation results of a morphological segmentation system. Most morphological segmentation systems focus only on segmentation rather than labelling morphs according to their roles in words, i.e. inflectional (cases, tenses etc.) vs. derivational. Nevertheless, it is helpful to have a better understanding of the roles of morphs in a word to be able to judge the grammatical function of that word in a sentence; i.e. the syntactic category. We believe that a good morph labelling system can also help partof-speech tagging. The proposed clustering algorithm can capture allomorphs in Turkish successfully. We obtain a recall of 86.34% for Turkish and 84.79% for English."

In this paper, we present two different methods for selecting the relevant senses of constituent words. The first one is based on Word Sense Induction and creates a static multi prototype vectors representing the senses of a constituent word. The second creates a single dynamic prototype vector for each constituent word based on the distributional properties of the other constituents in the compound. We use these prototype vectors for composing the semantics of noun-noun compounds and evaluate on a compositionality-based similarity task. Our results show that: (1) selecting relevant senses of the constituent words leads to a better semantic composition of the compound, and (2) dynamic prototypes perform better than static prototypes."

This paper presents an unsupervised method for inferring the hierarchical grouping of the senses of a polysemous word. The inferred hierarchical structures are applied to the problem of word sense disambiguation, where we show that our method performs significantly better than traditional graph-based methods and agglomerative clustering yielding improvements over state-of-the-art WSD systems based on sense induction."

P94-1035,An Attributive Logic of Set Descriptions and Set Operations,1994,17,14,1,1,30391,suresh manandhar,32nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"This paper provides a model theoretic semantics to feature terms augmented with set descriptions. We provide constraints to specify HPSG style set descriptions, fixed cardinality set descriptions, set-membership constraints, restricted universal role quantifications, set union, intersection, subset and disjointness. A sound, complete and terminating consistency checking procedure is provided to determine the consistency of any given term in the logic. It is shown that determining consistency of terms is a NP-complete problem."
