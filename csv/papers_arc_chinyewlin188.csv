In this opinion piece, we point out a few overlooked issues that are yet to be discussed in this line of work. We observe huge variance across different classification datasets amongst standard BERT-based NLI models and surprisingly find that pre-trained BERT without any fine-tuning can yield competitive performance against BERT fine-tuned for NLI. With the concern that these models heavily rely on spurious lexical patterns for prediction, we also experiment with preliminary approaches for more robust NLI, but the results are in general negative. Our observations reveal implicit but challenging difficulties in entailment-based zero-shot text classification."

Large-scale datasets recently proposed for generation contain loosely corresponding data text pairs, where part of spans in text cannot be aligned to its incomplete paired input. To learn semantic correspondences from such datasets, we propose a two-stage local-to-global alignment (L2GA) framework. First, a local model based on multi-instance learning is applied to build alignments for texts spans that can be directly grounded to its paired structured input. Then, a novel global model built upon a memory-guided conditional random field (CRF) layer aims to infer missing alignments for text spans which not supported by paired incomplete inputs, where the memory is designed to leverage alignment clues provided by the local model to strengthen the global model. In this way, the local model and global model can work jointly to learn semantic correspondences in the same framework. Experimental results show that our proposed method can be generalized to both restaurant and computer domains and improve the alignment accuracy."

Existing neural methods for encoding input data can be divided into two categories: a) pooling based encoders which ignore dependencies between input records or b) recurrent encoders which model only sequential dependencies between input records. In our investigation, although the recurrent encoder generally outperforms the pooling based encoder by learning the sequential dependencies, it is sensitive to the order of the input records (i.e., performance decreases when injecting the random shuffling noise over input data). To overcome this problem, we propose to adopt the self-attention mechanism to learn dependencies between arbitrary input records. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves comparable results and remains stable under random shuffling over input data."

Experiments on the E2E challenge dataset show that our proposed framework can reduce more than 50{\%} relative unaligned noise from the original data-text pairs.

They often assume that writing knowledge can be acquired from the training data alone. However, when people are writing, they not only rely on the data but also consider related knowledge. In this paper, we enhance neural data-to-text models with external knowledge in a simple but effective way to improve the fidelity of generated text. Besides relying on parallel data and text as in previous work, our model attends to relevant external knowledge, encoded as a temporary memory, and combines this knowledge with the context representation of data before generating words. This allows the model to infer relevant facts which are not explicitly stated in the data table from an external knowledge source. Experimental results on twenty-one Wikipedia infobox-to-text datasets show our model, KBAtt, consistently improves a state-of-the-art model on most of the datasets. In addition, to quantify when and why external knowledge is effective, we design a metric, KBGain, which shows a strong correlation with the observed performance boost. This result demonstrates the relevance of external knowledge and sparseness of original data are the main factors affecting system performance."

However, such mappings do not include the information of a few higher-order operations that cannot be explicitly represented in equations but are required to solve the problem. The gap between natural language and equations makes it difficult for a learned model to generalize from limited data. In this work we present an intermediate meaning representation scheme that tries to reduce this gap. We use a sequence-to-sequence model with a novel attention regularization term to generate the intermediate forms, then execute them to obtain the final answers. Since the intermediate forms are latent, we propose an iterative labeling framework for learning by leveraging supervision signals from both equations and answers. Our experiments show using intermediate forms outperforms directly predicting equations."

Entity linking in long text has been well studied in previous work. However, short text entity linking is more challenging since the text are noisy and less coherent. To better utilize the local information provided in short texts, we propose a novel neural network framework, Aggregated Semantic Matching (ASM), in which two different aspects of semantic information between the local context and the candidate entity are captured via representation-based and interaction-based neural semantic matching models, and then two matching signals work jointly for disambiguation with a rank aggregation mechanism. Our evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts on public tweet datasets."

The model takes math problem descriptions as input and generates equations as output. The advantage of sequence-to-sequence model requires no feature engineering and can generate equations that do not exist in training data. However, our experimental analysis reveals that this model suffers from two shortcomings: (1) generate spurious numbers; (2) generate numbers at wrong positions. In this paper, we propose incorporating copy and alignment mechanism to the sequence-to-sequence model (namely CASS) to address these shortcomings. To train our model, we apply reinforcement learning to directly optimize the solution accuracy. It overcomes the {``}train-test discrepancy{''} issue of maximum likelihood estimation, which uses the surrogate objective of maximizing equation likelihood during training while the evaluation metric is solution accuracy (non-differentiable) at test time. Furthermore, to explore the effectiveness of our neural model, we use our model output as a feature and incorporate it into the feature-based model. Experimental results show that (1) The copy and alignment mechanism is effective to address the two issues; (2) Reinforcement learning leads to better performance than maximum likelihood on this task; (3) Our neural model is complementary to the feature-based model and their combination significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results."

Fortunately, some mentions may have more cues for linking, which can be used as seed mentions to bridge other mentions and the uninformative entities. In this work, we select most linkable mentions as seed mentions and disambiguate other mentions by comparing them with the seed mentions rather than directly with the entities. Our experiments on linking mentions to seven automatically mined lists show promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

This profile is then used to automatically verify each linked mention individually, i.e., to predict whether it has been linked correctly or not. Verification allows leveraging a rich set of global and pairwise features that would be prohibitively expensive for EL systems employing global inference. Evaluation shows consistent improvements across datasets and systems. In particular, when applied to state-of-the-art systems, our method yields an absolute improvement in linking performance of up to 1.7 F1 on AIDA/CoNLL{'}03 and up to 2.4 F1 on the English TAC KBP 2015 TEDL dataset."

In recent works, when determining event types (trigger classification), most of the works are either pattern-only or feature-only.

In addition, when identifying and classifying arguments, previous works consider each candidate argument separately while ignoring the relationship between arguments. This paper proposes a Regularization-Based Pattern Balancing Method (RBPB). Inspired by the progress in representation learning, we use trigger embedding, sentence-level embedding and pattern features together as our features for trigger classification so that the effect of patterns and other useful features can be balanced. In addition, RBPB uses a regularization method to take advantage of the relationship between arguments. Experiments show that we achieve results better than current state-of-art equivalents."

The path ranking algorithm (PRA) is one of the most promising approaches to this task. Previous work on PRA usually follows a single-task learning paradigm, building a prediction model for each relation independently with its own training data. It ignores meaningful associations among certain relations, and might not get enough training data for less frequent relations. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework for PRA, referred to as coupled PRA (CPRA). It first devises an agglomerative clustering strategy to automatically discover relations that are highly correlated to each other, and then employs a multi-task learning strategy to effectively couple the prediction of such relations. As such, CPRA takes into account relation association and enables implicit data sharing among them. We empirically evaluate CPRA on benchmark data created from Freebase. Experimental results show that CPRA can effectively identify coherent clusters in which relations are highly correlated. By further coupling such relations, CPRA significantly outperforms PRA, in terms of both predictive accuracy and model interpretability."

In LRMC, we first assume the existence of a base segmenter (an implementation of any existing approach). Then, we utilize a key observation that queries with a similar intent tend to have consistent segmentations, to automatically collect a set of labeled data from the outputs of the base segmenter by leveraging search log data. Finally, we employ the auto-collected data to train a replacement model for selecting the correct segmentation of a new query from the outputs of the base segmenter.

Unsupervised algorithms are developed to extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance, but most of them rely on tagging arguments of predefined types. Recently, a new algorithm was proposed to jointly extract relations and their argument semantic classes, taking a set of relation instances extracted by an open IE algorithm as input. However, it cannot handle polysemy of relation phrases and fails to group many similar (synonymous) relation instances because of the sparseness of features. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm that provides a more general treatment of the polysemy and synonymy problems. The algorithm incorporates various knowledge sources which we will show to be very effective for unsupervised extraction. Moreover, it explicitly disambiguates polysemous relation phrases and groups synonymous ones. While maintaining approximately the same precision, the algorithm achieves significant improvement on recall compared to the previous method. It is also very efficient. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that it can handle 14.7 million relation instances and extract a very large set of relations from the web."

However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. To address this difficulty, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves Flmeasure of 82.5% in comparative question identification and 83.3% in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method."

Our key idea is to decompose the output label state into an active set and an inactive set in which most unsupported transitions become a constant.

We demonstrate that our method achieves dramatic speedup on six standard natural language processing problems."

We propose a novel and unified model by customizing the structural Support Vector Machine method. Our customization has several attractive properties: (1) it gives a comprehensive graphical representation of thread discussion. (2) It designs special inference algorithms instead of general-purpose ones. (3) It can be readily extended to different task preferences by varying loss functions. Experimental results on a real data set show that our methods are both promising and flexible.

In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question.

Then we model question topic and question focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying question topic and question focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying question topic and question focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR)."

We propose a novel binarization method utilizing rich information learnt from training corpus. Experimental results not only show that different binarizations have great impacts on parsing efficiency, but also confirm that our learnt binarization outperforms other existing methods. Furthermore we show that it is feasible to combine existing parsing speed-up techniques with our binarization to achieve even better performance."

According to the analysis, at least 78% of the cQA best answers are reusable when similar questions are asked again, but no more than 48% of them are indeed the unique best answers. We conduct the analysis by proposing taxonomies for cQA questions and answers. To better reuse the cQA content, we also propose applying automatic summarization techniques to summarize answers. Our results show that question-type oriented summarization techniques can improve cQA answer quality significantly."

This method is tested on DUC 2003, 2004, and 2005 systems and produces very good correlations with human judgments."

But the absence of a large semantic information repository that provides representations for sentences prevents the training of statistical CL engines and thus hampers the development of such semantics-enabled applications. This talk refers to recent work in several projects that seek to annotate large volumes of text with shallower or deeper representations of some semantic phenomena. It describes one of the essential problemsÂcreating, managing, and annotating (at large scale) the meanings of words, and outlines the Omega ontology, being built at ISI, that acts as term repository. The talk illustrates how one can proceed from words via senses to concepts, and how the annotation process can help verify good concept decisions and expose bad ones.

Research is being conducted in China, Europe, Japan, and North America, and industry has brought to market more than 30 summarization systems; most recently, a series of large-scale text summarization evaluations, Document Understanding Conference (DUC) and Text Summarization Challenge (TSC) have been held yearly in the United States and Japan. In this tutorial, we will review the state of the art in automatic summarization, and will discuss and critically evaluate current approaches to the problem. We will first outline the major types of summary: indicative vs. informative; abstract vs. extract; generic vs. query-oriented; background vs. just-the-news; single-document vs. multidocument; and so on. We will describe the typical decomposition of summarization into three stages, and explain in detail the major approaches to each stage. For topic identification, we will outline techniques based on stereotypical text structure, cue words, highfrequency indicator phrases, intratext connectivity, and discourse structure centrality. For topic fusion, we will outline some ideas that have been proposed, including concept generalization and semantic association. For summary generation, we will describe the problems of sentence planning to achieve information compaction. How good is a summary? Evaluation is a difficult issue. We will describe various suggested measures and discuss the adequacy of current evaluation methods including manual evaluation procedures used in DUC, the factoid and pyramid method reference summary creation procedures and fully automatic evaluation method such as ROUGE. The recently developed automatic evaluation method based on basic element (BE) will also be covered. Throughout, we will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical and symbolic/linguistic techniques in implementing efficient summarization systems. We will discuss ways in which summarization systems can interact with and/or complement natural language generation, discourse parsing, information extraction, and information retrieval systems. Finally, we will present a set of open problems that we perceive as being crucial for immediate progress in automatic summarization."

The first method is based on longest common subsequence between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations. Longest common subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence n-grams automatically. The second method relaxes strict n-gram matching to skip-bigram matching. Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order. Skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations. The empirical results show that both methods correlate with human judgments very well in both adequacy and fluency.

We also show the results of comparing several existing automatic metrics and three new automatic metrics using Orange."

For 100-word summaries, the performance upper bound, 0.65, achieved oracle extracts3.
