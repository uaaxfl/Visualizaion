Some systems propose the generation of simple text for low-skilled readers; some choose what they anticipate to be a xe2x80x9cgood measurexe2x80x9d of complexity by balancing sentence length and number of sentences (using scales such as the D-level sentence complexity) for the text; while others target high-skilled readers. In this work, we discuss an approach that aims to leverage the experience of the reader when reading generated text by matching the syntactic complexity of the generated text to the reading level of the surrounding text. We propose an approach for sentence aggregation and lexical choice that allows generated summaries of line graphs in multimodal articles available online to match the reading level of the text of the article in which the graphs appear. The technique is developed in the context of the SIGHT (Summarizing Information Graphics Textually) system. This paper tackles the micro planning phase of sentence generation discussing additionally the steps of lexical choice, and pronominalization."

It comprises a content selection phase that extracts the most important content of the graphic, an organization phase, which orders the propositions in a coherent manner, and a realization phase that uses the text surrounding the article to make decisions on the choice of lexical items and amount of aggregation applied to the propositions to generate the summary of the graphic."

Unfortunately, information retrieval research has focused on the retrieval of text documents and images, with almost no attention specifically directed toward the retrieval of information graphics. Our work is the first to directly tackle the retrieval of infographics and to design a system that takes into account their unique characteristics. Learning-to-rank algorithms are applied on a large set of features to develop several models for infographics retrieval. Evaluation of the models shows that features pertaining to the structure and the content of graphics should be taken into account when retrieving graphics and that doing so results in a model with better performance than a baseline model that relies on matching query words with words in the graphic."
J12-3004,Summarizing Information Graphics Textually,2012,79,11,2,1,18960,seniz demir,Computational Linguistics,0,"Information graphics (such as bar charts and line graphs) play a vital role in many multimodal documents. The majority of information graphics that appear in popular media are intended to convey a message and the graphic designer uses deliberate communicative signals, such as highlighting certain aspects of the graphic, in order to bring that message out. The graphic, whose communicative goal (intended message) is often not captured by the documentxe2x80x99s accompanying text, contributes to the overall purpose of the document and cannot be ignored. This article presents our approach to providing the high-level content of a non-scientific information graphic via a brief textual summary which includes the intended message and the salient features of the graphic. This work brings together insights obtained from empirical studies in order to determine what should be contained in the summaries of this form of non-linguistic input data, and how the information required for realizing the selected content can be extracted from the visual image and the textual components of the graphic. This work also presents a novel bottomxe2x80x93up generation approach to simultaneously construct the discourse and sentence structures of textual summaries by leveraging different discourse related considerations such as the syntactic complexity of realized sentences and clause embeddings.

Interpretation and generation are treated, respectively, as recognition of and construction of a responder's discourse plan for a full answer. An indirect answer is the result of the responder providing only part of the planned response, but intending for his discourse plan to be recognized by the questioner. Discourse plan construction and recognition make use of shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model by discourse plan operators. In the operators, coherence relations are used to characterize types of information that may accompany each type of answer. Recognizing a mutually plausible coherence relation obtaining between the actual response and a possible direct answer plays an important role in recognizing the responder's discourse plan. During generation, stimulus conditions model a speaker's motivation for selecting a satellite. Also during generation, the speaker uses his own interpretation capability to determine what parts of the plan are inferable by the hearer and thus do not need to be explicitly given. The model provides wider coverage than previous computational models for generating and interpreting indirect answers and extends the plan-based theory of implicature in several ways."

This paper presents a plan-based model for understanding cooperative negotiation subdialogues. Our system infers both the communicative actions that people pursue when speaking and the beliefs underlying these actions. Beliefs, and the strength of these beliefs, are recognized from the surface from of utterances, from discourse acts, and from the explicit and implicit acceptance of previous utterances. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse actions combines linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge in a unified framework. By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to model negotiation subdialogues. Since negotiation is an integral part of multiagent activity, our process model addresses an important aspect of cooperative interaction and thus is a step toward an intelligent and robust natural language consultation system."

In this paper, we present a plan-based model for response generation during collaborative planning, based on a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify framework for modeling collaboration. We focus on identifying strategies for content selection when 1) the system initiates information-sharing to gather further information in order to make an informed decision about whether to accept a proposal from the user, and 2) the system initiates collaborative negotiation to negotiate with the user to resolve a detected conflict in the user's proposal. When our model determines that information-sharing should be pursued, it selects a focus of information-sharing from among multiple uncertainties that might be addressed, chooses an appropriate information-sharing strategy, and formulates a response that initiates an information-sharing subdialogue. When our model determines that conflicts must be resolved, it selects the most effective conflicts to address in resolving disagreement about the user's proposal, identifies appropriate justification for the system's claims, and formulates a response that initiates a negotiation subdialogue."

In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the task at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues."

We present the approach to generation used in our implemented system for generating and interpreting indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. Generation of a discourse plan is performed in two phases: content planning and plan pruning. During content planning, stimulus conditions are used to trigger speaker goals to include appropriate extra information with the direct answer. Plan pruning determines what parts of this full response do not need to be stated explicitly - resulting in, in appropriate discourse contexts, the generation of an indirect answer."

Our algorithms make use of discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations. The algorithms calculate implicatures of discourse units of one or more sentences. Our approach has several advantages. First, by taking discourse relations into account, it can capture a variety of implicatures not handled before. Second, by treating implicatures of discourse units which may consist of more than one sentence, it avoids the limitations of a sentence-at-a-time approach. Third, by making use of properties of discourse which have been used in models of other discourse phenomena, our approach can be integrated with those models.

Discourse expectations and focusing heuristics are used to facilitate recognition of an information-seeker's intent in uttering an elliptical fragment. The ellipsis is comprehended by identifying both the aspect of the information-seeker's task-related plan highlighted by the fragment and the conversational discourse goal fulfilled by the utterance.

One of the most important components of a user model is a representation of the system's beliefs about the underlying task-related plan motivating an information-seeker's queries. These beliefs can be used to interpret subsequent utterances and produce useful responses. This paper describes the IREPS system, emphasizing its dynamic construction of the task-related plan motivating the information-seeker's queries and the application of this component of a user model to handling utterances that violate the pragmatic rules of the system's world model. By reasoning on a model of the user's plans and goals, the system often can deduce the intended meaning of faulty utterances and allow the dialogue to continue without interruption. Some limitations of current plan inference systems are discussed. It is suggested that the problem of detecting and recovering from discrepancies between the system's model of the user's plan and the actual plan under construction by the user requires an enriched model that differentiates among its components on the basis of the support the system accords each component as a correct and intended part of the user's plan."

The selection strategy we present involves weighting possible strategic predicates and the propositions used to fill them at multiple points throughout an ongoing dialogue and at the actual time of giving the definition. Weighting will be influenced by a model of the user's domain knowledge, task-related plans and goals, and receptivity to the different kinds of information that could be presented.

A number of researchers have modeled the plan inference process and used these models to design more robust natural language interfaces. However in each case, it has been assumed that the system's context model and the plan under construction by the information-seeker are never at variance. This paper addresses the problem of disparate plans. It presents a four phase approach and argues that handling disparate plans requires an enriched context model. This model must permit the addition of components suggested by the information seeker but not fully supported by the system's domain knowledge, and must differentiate among its components according to the kind of support accorded each component as a correct part of the information-seeker's overall plan. It is shown how a component's support should affect the system's hypothesis about the source of error once plan disparity is suggested."
