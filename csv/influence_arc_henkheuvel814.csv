Finally, we will provide some statistics from the database detailing the codeswitching and speaker information before the concluding the paper. 2. Related Work Investigation of code-switching in the context of automatic speech recognition research has become viable with several code-switching databases that have been proposed in the last years (Lyu et al., 2015; Li and Fung, 2012; Dey and Fung, 2014; Chan et al., 2005; Imseng et al., 2012). These databases contain recordings of MandarinEnglish, Hindi-English, Cantonese-English and FrenchGerman code-switching speech data. The automatic speech recognition systems applied on these data use bilingual pronunciation dictionary and language models to be able to cope with the language switch. Moreover, several language identification techniques are adopted to label the speech segments with the spoken language and perform accurate acoustic and language modeling based on these labels. Longitudinal speech databases have been designed for exploring"

The goal of CARE was to semi-automatically convert text documents of the first two parts of the two dictionaries to structured text (database), and to combine these data with those of the third part. The input format was scanned text, read by optical character recognition (OCR). As output format the Lexical Markup Framework LMF was chosen, as it is an accepted standard in CLARIN for lexical data. In Van den Heuvel, Sanders & Van der Sijs (2016) the methodology used has been described in detail. Figure 3. An example of the phonetic symbols used in WLD All resulting LMF-files were stored in open access at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam (which is a CLARIN Data Centre). The next step was to design and implement a webportal. The idea was that a complete, curated database with a transparent webinterface providing precise and powerful selection and search tools would open up new avenues for dialect research in the Brabant and Limburg areas, in particular because the data are there for everyone on the internet.

This too hampered computer reading, but in a less interfering way. Along these lines we managed to greatly improve the process of data curation. Figure 2. The nine Brabantic dialect areas The third parts of the dictionaries were prepared by the editors on the computer, using a tailor-made version of FileMaker Pro. These parts have been made digitally available on a website in 2004, as a result of the NWO project D-Square. To this website a cartographic tool was added (Van den Heuvel et al., 2015; de Vriend et al., 2006). No cross-checks were performed on data consistency in Dsquare and the database only had limited search functions, accessible through a meanwhile fairly obsolete interface.
