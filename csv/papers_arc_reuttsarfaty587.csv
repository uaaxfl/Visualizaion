However, the lack of a clear linguistic definition for words destines the annotative work to be incomplete and mired in inconsistencies, especially cross-linguistically. In this work we expand morphological inflection of words to inflection of sentences to provide true universality disconnected from orthographic traditions of white-space usage. To allow annotation for sentence-inflection we define a morphological annotation scheme by a fixed set of inflectional features. We present a small cross-linguistic dataset including semi-manually generated simple sentences in 4 typologically diverse languages annotated according to our suggested scheme, and show that the task of reinflection gets substantially more difficult but that the change of scope from words to well-defined sentences allows interface with contextualized language models."

To this end, we introduce the task of role question generation, which, given a predicate mention and a passage, requires producing a set of questions asking about all possible semantic roles of the predicate. We develop a two-stage model for this task, which first produces a context-independent question prototype for each role and then revises it to be contextually appropriate for the passage. Unlike most existing approaches to question generation, our approach does not require conditioning on existing answers in the text. Instead, we condition on the type of information to inquire about, regardless of whether the answer appears explicitly in the text, could be inferred from it, or should be sought elsewhere. Our evaluation demonstrates that we generate diverse and well-formed questions for a large, broad-coverage ontology of predicates and roles."

In this work we aim to overcome this annotation bottleneck by bootstrapping labeled data from a seed as small as \textit{five} labeled inflection tables, accompanied by a large bulk of unlabeled text. Our bootstrapping method exploits the orthographic and semantic regularities in morphological systems in a two-phased setup, where word tagging based on \textit{analogies} is followed by word pairing based on \textit{distances}. Our experiments with the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem over eight typologically different languages show that in languages with relatively simple morphology, orthographic regularities on their own allow inflection models to achieve respectable accuracy. Combined orthographic and semantic regularities alleviate difficulties with particularly complex morpho-phonological systems. We further show that our bootstrapping methods substantially outperform hallucination-based methods commonly used for overcoming the annotation bottleneck in morphological reinflection tasks."

Modality is important for many NLP downstream tasks such as the detection of hedging, uncertainty, speculation, and more. Previous studies that address modality detection in NLP often restrict modal expressions to a closed syntactic class, and the modal sense labels are vastly different across different studies, lacking an accepted standard. Furthermore, these senses are often analyzed independently of the events that they modify. This work builds on the theoretical foundations of the Georgetown Gradable Modal Expressions (GME) work by Rubinstein et al. (2013) to propose an event-based modality detection task where modal expressions can be words of any syntactic class and sense labels are drawn from a comprehensive taxonomy which harmonizes the modal concepts contributed by the different studies. We present experiments on the GME corpus aiming to detect and classify fine-grained modal concepts and associate them with their modified events. We show that detecting and classifying modal expressions is not only feasible, it also improves the detection of modal events in their own right."

In Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRLs) which exhibit morphological fusion and non-concatenative morphology, the different units of meaning within a word may be fused, intertwined, and cannot be separated linearly. Therefore, when using word-pieces in MRLs, we must consider that: (1) a linear segmentation into sub-word units might not capture the full morphological complexity of words; and (2) representations that leave morphological knowledge on sub-word units inaccessible might negatively affect performance. Here we empirically examine the capacity of word-pieces to capture morphology by investigating the task of multi-tagging in Modern Hebrew, as a proxy to evaluate the underlying segmentation. Our results show that, while models trained to predict multi-tags for complete words outperform models tuned to predict the distinct tags of WPs, we can improve the WPs tag prediction by purposefully constraining the word-pieces to reflect their internal functions. We suggest that linguistically-informed word-pieces schemes, that make the morphological structure explicit, might boost performance for MRLs."

In this work, we follow known methodologies of collecting labeled data for the complement coercion phenomenon. These are constructions with an implied action {---} e.g., {``}I started a new book I bought last week{''}, where the implied action is reading. We aim to collect annotated data for this phenomenon by reducing it to either of two known tasks: Explicit Completion and Natural Language Inference. However, in both cases, crowdsourcing resulted in low agreement scores, even though we followed the same methodologies as in previous work. Why does the same process fail to yield high agreement scores? We specify our modeling schemes, highlight the differences with previous work and provide some insights about the task and possible explanations for the failure. We conclude that specific phenomena require tailored solutions, not only in specialized algorithms, but also in data collection methods."

This setup has been studied in the vision community under the name zero-shot learning from text, focusing on learning to transfer knowledge about visual aspects of birds from seen classes to previously-unseen ones. Here, we suggest focusing on the textual description and distilling from the description the most relevant information to effectively match visual features to the parts of the text that discuss them. Specifically, (1) we propose to leverage the similarity between species, reflected in the similarity between text descriptions of the species. (2) we derive visual summaries of the texts, i.e., extractive summaries that focus on the visual features that tend to be reflected in images. We propose a simple attention-based model augmented with the similarity and visual summaries components.

Unfortunately, when a dataset has systematic gaps (e.g., annotation artifacts), these evaluations are misleading: a model can learn simple decision rules that perform well on the test set but do not capture the abilities a dataset is intended to test. We propose a more rigorous annotation paradigm for NLP that helps to close systematic gaps in the test data. In particular, after a dataset is constructed, we recommend that the dataset authors manually perturb the test instances in small but meaningful ways that (typically) change the gold label, creating contrast sets. Contrast sets provide a local view of a model{'}s decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model{'}s true linguistic capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of contrast sets by creating them for 10 diverse NLP datasets (e.g., DROP reading comprehension, UD parsing, and IMDb sentiment analysis). Although our contrast sets are not explicitly adversarial, model performance is significantly lower on them than on the original test sets{---}up to 25{\%} in some cases. We release our contrast sets as new evaluation benchmarks and encourage future dataset construction efforts to follow similar annotation processes."

In this paper we address the issue of unbalanced morphological ambiguities in Hebrew. We offer a challenge set for Hebrew homographs {---} the first of its kind {---} containing substantial attestation of each analysis of 21 Hebrew homographs. We show that the current SOTA of Hebrew disambiguation performs poorly on cases of unbalanced ambiguity.

Neural MD may be addressed as a simple pipeline, where segmentation is followed by sequence tagging, or as an end-to-end model, predicting morphemes from raw tokens. Both approaches are sub-optimal; the former is heavily prone to error propagation, and the latter does not enjoy explicit access to the basic processing units called morphemes. This paper offers MD architecture that combines the symbolic knowledge of morphemes with the learning capacity of neural end-to-end modeling. We propose a new, general and easy-to-implement Pointer Network model where the input is a morphological lattice and the output is a sequence of indices pointing at a single disambiguated path of morphemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model on segmentation and tagging, for Hebrew and Turkish texts, based on their respective Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. Our experiments show that with complete lattices, our model outperforms all shared-task results on segmenting and tagging these languages. On the SPMRL treebank, our model outperforms all previously reported results for Hebrew MD in realistic scenarios."

Therefore, these representations lack many explicit connections between content words, that would be useful for downstream applications. Proposals like English Enhanced UD improve the situation by extending universal dependency trees with additional explicit arcs. However, they are not available to Python users, and are also limited in coverage. We introduce a broad-coverage, data-driven and linguistically sound set of transformations, that makes event-structure and many lexical relations explicit. We present pyBART, an easy-to-use open-source Python library for converting English UD trees either to Enhanced UD graphs or to our representation. The library can work as a standalone package or be integrated within a spaCy NLP pipeline. When evaluated in a pattern-based relation extraction scenario, our representation results in higher extraction scores than Enhanced UD, while requiring fewer patterns."

In this work we empirically confirm this hypothesis for Modern Hebrew, an MRL with complex morphology and severe word-level ambiguity, in a novel transition-based framework. Specifically, we propose a joint morphosyntactic transition-based framework which formally unifies two distinct transition systems, morphological and syntactic, into a single transition-based system with joint training and joint inference. We empirically show that MA{\&}D results obtained in the joint settings outperform MA{\&}D results obtained by the respective standalone components, and that end-to-end parsing results obtained by our joint system present a new state of the art for Hebrew dependency parsing."

This paper describes the design and use of the ONLP suite, a joint morpho-syntactic infrastructure for processing Modern Hebrew texts. The joint inference over morphology and syntax substantially limits error propagation, and leads to high accuracy.

We hypothesise that for MRLs, languages where multiple meaning-bearing elements may be carried by a single space-delimited token, these choices will have measurable effects on task perfromance, and that these effects may vary for different architectural designs {---} fully-connected, convolutional or recurrent. Specifically, we hypothesize that morpheme-based representations will have advantages in terms of their generalization capacity and task accuracy, due to their better OOV coverage.

The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurallyand morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SDannotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy."

J13-1003,Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages: Introduction to the Special Issue,2013,32,40,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Computational Linguistics,0,"Parsing is a key task in natural language processing. It involves predicting, for each natural language sentence, an abstract representation of the grammatical entities in the sentence and the relations between these entities. This representation provides an interface to compositional semantics and to the notions of who did what to whom. The last two decades have seen great advances in parsing English, leading to major leaps also in the performance of applications that use parsers as part of their backbone, such as systems for information extraction, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and machine translation. Attempts to replicate the success of parsing English for other languages have often yielded unsatisfactory results. In particular, parsing languages with complex word structure and flexible word order has been shown to require non-trivial adaptation. This special issue reports on methods that successfully address the challenges involved in parsing a range of morphologically rich languages MRLs. This introduction characterizes MRLs, describes the challenges in parsing MRLs, and outlines the contributions of the articles in the special issue. These contributions present up-to-date research efforts that address parsing in varied, cross-lingual settings. They show that parsing MRLs addresses challenges that transcend particular representational and algorithmic choices."
P12-2002,Joint Evaluation of Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsing,2012,19,11,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),0,We present novel metrics for parse evaluation in joint segmentation and parsing scenarios where the gold sequence of terminals is not known in advance. The protocol uses distance-based metrics defined for the space of trees over lattices. Our metrics allow us to precisely quantify the performance gap between non-realistic parsing scenarios (assuming gold segmented and tagged input) and realistic ones (not assuming gold segmentation and tags). Our evaluation of segmentation and parsing for Modern Hebrew sheds new light on the performance of the best parsing systems to date in the different scenarios.

Converting outputs from one framework to another is less than optimal as it easily introduces noise into the process. Here we present a principled protocol for evaluating parsing results across frameworks based on function trees, tree generalization and edit distance metrics. This extends a previously proposed framework for cross-theory evaluation and allows us to compare a wider class of parsers. We demonstrate the usefulness and language independence of our procedure by evaluating constituency and dependency parsers on English and Swedish."

This paper develops a robust procedure for cross-experimental evaluation, based on deterministic unification-based operations for harmonizing different representations and a refined notion of tree edit distance for evaluating parse hypotheses relative to multiple gold standards. We demonstrate that, for different conversions of the Penn Treebank into dependencies, performance trends that are observed for parsing results in isolation change or dissolve completely when parse hypotheses are normalized and brought into the same common ground."

There is ample evidence that the application of readily available statistical parsing models to such languages is susceptible to serious performance degradation. The first workshop on statistical parsing of MRLs hosts a variety of contributions which show that despite language-specific idiosyncrasies, the problems associated with parsing MRLs cut across languages and parsing frameworks. In this paper we review the current state-of-affairs with respect to parsing MRLs and point out central challenges. We synthesize the contributions of researchers working on parsing Arabic, Basque, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi and Korean to point out shared solutions across languages. The overarching analysis suggests itself as a source of directions for future investigations."

In particular, we show that an extension of the Relational-Realizational (RR) model that incorporates agreement features is superior to CB models that treat morphosyntax as state-splits (SP), and that the RR model benefits more from inflectional features. We focus on parsing Hebrew and report the best result to date, F184.13 for parsing off of gold-tagged text, 5% error reduction from previous results."

This is achieved by defining a stochastic mapping layer between the two resources. Lexical probabilities for rare events are estimated in a semi-supervised manner from a lexicon and large unannotated corpora. We show that this solution greatly enhances the performance of an unlexicalized Hebrew PCFG parser, resulting in state-of-the-art Hebrew parsing results both when a segmentation oracle is assumed, and in a real-word parsing scenario of parsing unsegmented tokens."
D09-1088,An Alternative to Head-Driven Approaches for Parsing a (Relatively) Free Word-Order Language,2009,30,6,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,0,Applying statistical parsers developed for English to languages with freer word-order has turned out to be harder than expected. This paper investigates the adequacy of different statistical parsing models for dealing with a (relatively) free word-order language. We show that the recently proposed Relational-Realizational (RR) model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Head-Driven (HD) models on the Hebrew Treebank. Our analysis reveals a weakness of HD models: their intrinsic focus on configurational information. We conclude that the form-function separation ingrained in RR models makes them better suited for parsing nonconfigurational phenomena.

These words are in turn highly ambiguous, breaking the assumption underlying most parsers that the yield of a tree for a given sentence is known in advance. Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity. Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far."

Annotation Strategies for {M}odern {H}ebrew Clitics,2008,22,10,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'08),0,"Morphologically rich languages pose a challenge to the annotators of treebanks with respect to the status of orthographic (space-delimited) words in the syntactic parse trees. In such languages an orthographic word may carry various, distinct, sorts of information and the question arises whether we should represent such words as a sequence of their constituent morphemes (i.e., a Morpheme-Based annotation strategy) or whether we should preserve their special orthographic status within the trees (i.e., a Word-Based annotation strategy). In this paper we empirically address this challenge in the context of the development of Language Resources for Modern Hebrew. We compare and contrast the Morpheme-Based and Word-Based annotation strategies of pronominal clitics in Modern Hebrew and we show that the Word-Based strategy is more adequate for the purpose of training statistical parsers as it provides a better PP-attachment disambiguation capacity and a better alignment with initial surface forms. Our findings in turn raise new questions concerning the interaction of morphological and syntactic processing of which investigation is facilitated by the parallel treebank we made available."
C08-1112,Relational-Realizational Parsing,2008,22,35,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008),0,"State-of-the-art statistical parsing models applied to free word-order languages tend to underperform compared to, e.g., parsing English. Constituency-based models often fail to capture generalizations that cannot be stated in structural terms, and dependency-based models employ a 'single-head' assumption that often breaks in the face of multiple exponence. In this paper we suggest that the position of a constituent is a form manifestation of its grammatical function, one among various possible means of realization. We develop the Relational-Realizational approach to parsing in which we untangle the projection of grammatical functions and their means of realization to allow for phrase-structure variability and morphological-syntactic interaction. We empirically demonstrate the application of our approach to parsing Modern Hebrew, obtaining 7% error reduction from previously reported results."
W07-2219,Three-Dimensional Parametrization for Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages,2007,26,14,1,1,5249,reut tsarfaty,Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Parsing Technologies,0,"Current parameters of accurate unlexicalized parsers based on Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) form a two-dimensional grid in which rewrite events are conditioned on both horizontal (head-outward) and vertical (parental) histories. In Semitic languages, where arguments may move around rather freely and phrase-structures are often shallow, there are additional morphological factors that govern the generation process. Here we propose that agreement features percolated up the parse-tree form a third dimension of parametrization that is orthogonal to the previous two. This dimension differs from mere state-splits as it applies to a whole set of categories rather than to individual ones and encodes linguistically motivated co-occurrences between them. This paper presents extensive experiments with extensions of unlexicalized PCFGs for parsing Modern Hebrew in which tuning the parameters in three dimensions gradually leads to improved performance. Our best result introduces a new, stronger, lower bound on the performance of treebank grammars for parsing Modern Hebrew, and is on a par with current results for parsing Modern Standard Arabic obtained by a fully lexicalized parser trained on a much larger treebank."

This work represents a first attempt at modeling morphological-syntactic interaction in a generative probabilistic framework to allow for MH parsing. We show that morphological information selected in tandem with syntactic categories is instrumental for parsing Semitic languages. We further show that redundant morphological information helps syntactic disambiguation."
