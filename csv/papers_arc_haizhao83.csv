Previous works have shown that incorporating span-level information over consecutive words in pre-training could further improve the performance of PrLMs. However, given that span-level clues are introduced and fixed in pre-training, previous methods are time-consuming and lack of flexibility. To alleviate the inconvenience, this paper presents a novel span fine-tuning method for PrLMs, which facilitates the span setting to be adaptively determined by specific downstream tasks during the fine-tuning phase. In detail, any sentences processed by the PrLM will be segmented into multiple spans according to a pre-sampled dictionary. Then the segmentation information will be sent through a hierarchical CNN module together with the representation outputs of the PrLM and ultimately generate a span-enhanced representation. Experiments on GLUE benchmark show that the proposed span fine-tuning method significantly enhances the PrLM, and at the same time, offer more flexibility in an efficient way."

To alleviate such difficulties, previous models focus on how to incorporate these information using complex graph-based modules and additional manually labeled data, which is usually rare in real scenarios. In this paper, we design two labour-free self- and pseudo-self-supervised prediction tasks on speaker and key-utterance to implicitly model the speaker information flows, and capture salient clues in a long dialogue. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets have justified the effectiveness of our method over competitive baselines and current state-of-the-art models."

For extractive MRC, the answer span has been shown mostly determined by key evidence linguistic units, in which it is a sentence in most cases. However, we recently discovered that sentences may not be clearly defined in many languages to different extents, so that this causes so-called location unit ambiguity problem and as a result makes it difficult for the model to determine which sentence exactly contains the answer span when sentence itself has not been clearly defined at all. Taking Chinese language as a case study, we explain and analyze such a linguistic phenomenon and correspondingly propose a reader with Explicit Span-Sentence Predication to alleviate such a problem. Our proposed reader eventually helps achieve a new state-of-the-art on Chinese MRC benchmark and shows great potential in dealing with other languages."

In this work, we propose an effective gating strategy by smoothing the two dialogue states in only one decoder and bridge decision making and question generation to provide a richer dialogue state reference.

In detail, we introduce a dual-encoder design, in which a pair encoder especially focuses on candidate aspect-opinion pair classification, and the original encoder keeps attention on sequence labeling. Empirical results show that our proposed model shows robustness and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on four benchmark datasets."

Due to the limitations of modeling methods and the conditions of pre-identified predicates, previous work has focused on the relationships between predicates and arguments and the correlations between arguments at most, while the correlations between predicates have been neglected for a long time. High-order features and structure learning were very common in modeling such correlations before the neural network era. In this paper, we introduce a high-order graph structure for the neural semantic role labeling model, which enables the model to explicitly consider not only the isolated predicate-argument pairs but also the interaction between the predicate-argument pairs.

As a result, LIMIT-BERT not only improves linguistics tasks performance but also benefits from a regularization effect and linguistics information that leads to more general representations to help adapt to new tasks and domains.

However, most of the existing LM growing methods need an extra monolingual corpus, where additional LM adaption technology is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based bilingual LM growing method, only using the bilingual parallel corpus in SMT. The results show that our method can improve both the perplexity score for LM evaluation and BLEU score for SMT, and significantly outperforms the existing LM growing methods without extra corpus."

This strategy is tentatively applied to machine translation between Vietnamese and Chinese. During the semantic translation, Vietnamese syllables are one-by-one converted into the corresponding Chinese characters. During the grammar translation, the sequences of Chinese characters in Vietnamese grammar order are modified and rearranged to form grammatical Chinese sentence. Compared to the existing single alignment model, the division of two-stage processing is more targeted for research and evaluation of machine translation. The proposed method is evaluated using the standard BLEU score and a new manual evaluation metric, understanding rate. Only based on a small number of dictionaries, the proposed method gives competitive and even better results compared to existing systems."

The conventional alignment scheme, which is developed for machine translation, only marks the paraphrases and hyponyms to justify the entailment pairs, while provides less support for the non-entailment ones. This paper proposes a novel alignment scheme, named labeled alignment, to address this problem, which introduces negative links to explicitly mark the contradictory expressions to justify the non-entailment pairs. Thus the alignment-based RTE method employing the proposed scheme, compared with those employing the conventional one, can gain accuracy improvement through actively detecting the signals of non-entailment. The experimental results on the data sets of two shared RTE tasks indicate the implemented system significantly outperforms both the baseline system and all the other submitted systems."

However, it has been subjected to lacking a proper evaluation metric for a long time. The natural metric for IME is user experience, which is a rather vague goal for research purpose. We propose a novel approach of quantifying user experience by using keystroke count and then correspondingly develop a framework of IME evaluation, which is fast and accurate. With the underlying linguistic background, the proposed evaluation framework can properly model the user behavior as Chinese is input through English keyboard. It is helpful to point out a way to improve the current Chinese IME performance. 1"

In contrast, we propose a method for converting CSLMs into back-off n-gram language models (BNLMs) so that we can use converted CSLMs in decoding. We show that they outperform the original BNLMs and are comparable with the traditional use of CSLMs in reranking."

However, the top-down method suffers from accuracy deficiency, that is, its accuracy is generally lower than that of the flat approach of 1-vs-Rest. In this paper, we employ meta-classification technique to enhance the classifying procedure of the top-down method. We analyze the proposed method on the aspect of accuracy, and then test it with two realworld large-scale data sets. Our method both maintains the efficiency of the conventional top-down method and provides competitive classification accuracies."

As Chinese text is made up of character sequences rather than word sequences, word in Chinese is not so natural a concept as in English, nor is word easy to be defined without argument for such a language. Therefore we propose a character-level dependency scheme to represent primary linguistic relationships within a Chinese sentence. The usefulness of character dependencies are verified through two specialized dependency parsing tasks. The first is to handle trivial character dependencies that are equally transformed from traditional word boundaries. The second furthermore considers the case that annotated internal character dependencies inside a word are involved. Both of these results from character-level dependency parsing are positive. This study provides an alternative way to formularize basic character-and word-level representation for Chinese."
