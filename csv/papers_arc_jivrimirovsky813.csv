The lexicon is one of the outcomes of the research on anaphoricity and long-distance relations in discourse, it contains at present anaphoric connectives (ACs) for Czech and German connectives, and further their possible translations documented in bilingual parallel corpora (not necessarily anaphoric). As a basis, we use two existing monolingual lexicons of connectives: the Lexicon of Czech Discourse Connectives (CzeDLex) and the Lexicon of Discourse Markers (DiMLex) for German, interlink their relevant entries via semantic annotation of the connectives (according to the PDTB 3 sense taxonomy) and statistical information of translation possibilities from the Czech and German parallel data of the InterCorp project. The lexicon is, as far as we know, the first bilingual inventory of connectives with linkage on the level of individual entries, and a first attempt to systematically describe devices engaged in long-distance, non-local discourse coherence.

Its new version CzeDLex 0.6 (as compared with the previous version 0.5, which was published in 2017) is significantly larger with respect to manually processed entries. Also, its structure has been modified to allow for primary connectives to appear with multiple entries for a single discourse sense. The lexicon comes in several formats, being both human and machine readable, and is available for searching in PML Tree Query, a user-friendly and powerful search tool for all kinds of linguistically annotated treebanks. The main purpose of this paper/demo is to present the new version of the lexicon and to demonstrate possibilities of mining various types of information from the lexicon using PML Tree Query; we present several examples of search queries over the lexicon data along with their results. The new version of the lexicon, CzeDLex{\textasciitilde}0.6, is available on-line and was officially released in December 2019 under the Creative Commons License."

The main aim of the paper is to test a hypothesis that obligatory adverbials (in terms of the valency) follow the non-obligatory (i.e. optional) ones in the surface word order. The determined hypothesis was tested by creating a list of features for the decision trees algorithm and by searching in data of the Prague Dependency Treebank using the search tool PML Tree Query. Apart from the valency, our experiment also evaluates importance of several other features, such as argument length and deep syntactic function. Neither of the used methods has proved the given hypothesis but according to the results, there are several other features that influence word order of contextually non-bound free modifiers of a verb in Czech, namely position of the sentence in the text, form and length of the verb modifiers (the whole subtrees), and the semantic dependency relation (functor) of the modifiers."

It concentrates on the relationship between (formal) dependencies and word order. The investigation is performed by means of a semi-automatic application of a method of analysis by reduction to Czech syntactically annotated data. The paper also presents the analysis of introspectively created Czech sentences demonstrating complex phenomena which are not sufficiently represented in the corpus. The focus is on non-projective structures, esp. those connected with the position of clitics in Czech. The freedom of word order is expressed by means of a number of necessary shifts in the process of analysis by reduction. The paper shows that this measure provides a new view of the problem, it is orthogonal to measures reflecting the word order freedom based on a number of non-projective constructions or clitics in a sentence. It also helps to identify language phenomena that generally pose a problem for dependencybased formalisms."

The demonstrative pronoun typically signals a referential link to an antecedent, whereas the whole expression can, but does not have to, carry a discourse meaning in sense of discourse connectives. We describe the properties of these phrases/expressions with regard to their antecedents, their position among the text-structuring language means and their features typical for the Âconnective functionÂ of them compared to their Ânon-connective functionÂ. The analysis is carried out on Czech data from the approx. 50,000 sentences of the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0, directly on the syntactic trees. We explore the characteristics of these phrases/expressions discovered during two projects: the manual annotation of 1, coreference relations (Nedoluzhko et al. 2011) and 2, discourse connectives, their scopes and meanings (Mladov{\'a} et al. 2008)."

The decision to annotate discourse structure directly on the trees contrasts with the majority of similarly aimed projects, usually based on the annotation of linear texts. Our basic assumption is that some syntactic features of a sentence analysis correspond to certain discourselevel features. Hence, we use some properties of the dependency-based large-scale treebank of Czech to help establish an independent annotation layer of discourse. The question that we answer in the paper is how much did we gain by employing this approach. TITLE AND ABSTRACT IN CZECH Pomaha tektogramatika pxc5x99i anotaci diskurznich vztahxc5xaf?"
