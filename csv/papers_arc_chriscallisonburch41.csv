In the absence of parallel data, several approaches have turned to the use of images to learn translations. Since images of words, e.g., horse may be unchanged across languages, translations can be identified via images associated with words in different languages that have a high degree of visual similarity. However, translating via images has been shown to improve upon text-only models only marginally. To better understand when images are useful for translation, we study image translatability of words, which we define as the translatability of words via images, by measuring intra- and inter-cluster similarities of image representations of words that are translations of each other. We find that images of words are not always invariant across languages, and that language pairs with shared culture, meaning having either a common language family, ethnicity or religion, have improved image translatability (i.e., have more similar images for similar words) compared to its converse, regardless of their geographic proximity. In addition, in line with previous works that show images help more in translating concrete words, we found that concrete words have improved image translatability compared to abstract ones."

The practice of fact checking won{'}t suffice to eliminate the biases in text data we observe, as the degree of factuality alone does not determine whether biases exist in the spectrum of opinions visible to us. To better understand controversial issues, one needs to view them from a diverse yet comprehensive set of perspectives. For example, there are many ways to respond to a claim such as {``}animals should have lawful rights{''}, and these responses form a spectrum of perspectives, each with a stance relative to this claim and, ideally, with evidence supporting it. Inherently, this is a natural language understanding task, and we propose to address it as such. Specifically, we propose the task of substantiated perspective discovery where, given a claim, a system is expected to discover a diverse set of well-corroborated perspectives that take a stance with respect to the claim. Each perspective should be substantiated by evidence paragraphs which summarize pertinent results and facts. We construct PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of claims, perspectives and evidence, making use of online debate websites to create the initial data collection, and augmenting it using search engines in order to expand and diversify our dataset.

We aim to alleviate this issue through the use of two main techniques. First, we incorporate content word complexities, as predicted with a leveled word complexity model, into our loss function during training. Second, we generate a large set of diverse candidate simplifications at test time, and rerank these to promote fluency, adequacy, and simplicity.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm, EntitySpike, that identifies entities that spike in popularity in tweets from a given time period, and constructs an alias list for these spiked entities. EntitySpike uses a temporal heuristic to identify named entities with similar context that occur in the same time period (within minutes) during an event. Each entity is encoded as a vector using this temporal heuristic. We show how these entity-vectors can be used to create a named entity alias list. We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset of temporally ordered tweets from a single event, the 2013 Grammy Awards show. We carried out various experiments on tweets that were published in the same time period and show that our algorithm identifies most entity name aliases and outperforms a competitive baseline."
W17-1914,Word Sense Filtering Improves Embedding-Based Lexical Substitution,2017,23,3,3,1,24896,anne cocos,"Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Sense, Concept and Entity Representations and their Applications",0,The role of word sense disambiguation in lexical substitution has been questioned due to the high performance of vector space models which propose good substitutes without explicitly accounting for sense. We show that a filtering mechanism based on a sense inventory optimized for substitutability can improve the results of these models. Our sense inventory is constructed using a clustering method which generates paraphrase clusters that are congruent with lexical substitution annotations in a development set. The results show that lexical substitution can still benefit from senses which can improve the output of vector space paraphrase ranking models.

J17-2001,A Comprehensive Analysis of Bilingual Lexicon Induction,2017,56,10,2,1,32782,ann irvine,Computational Linguistics,0,"Bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora in two languages. In this article we present the most comprehensive analysis of bilingual lexicon induction to date. We present experiments on a wide range of languages and data sizes. We examine translation into English from 25 foreign languages: Albanian, Azeri, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Cebuano, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Latvian, Nepali, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Somali, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Vietnamese, and Welsh. We analyze the behavior of bilingual lexicon induction on low-frequency words, rather than testing solely on high-frequency words, as previous research has done. Low-frequency words are more relevant to statistical machine translation, where systems typically lack translations of rare words that fall outside of their training data. We systematically explore a wide range of features and phenomena that affect the quality of the translations discovered by bilingual lexicon induction. We provide illustrative examples of the highest ranking translations for orthogonal signals of translation equivalence like contextual similarity and temporal similarity. We analyze the effects of frequency and burstiness, and the sizes of the seed bilingual dictionaries and the monolingual training corpora. Additionally, we introduce a novel discriminative approach to bilingual lexicon induction. Our discriminative model is capable of combining a wide variety of features that individually provide only weak indications of translation equivalence. When feature weights are discriminatively set, these signals produce dramatically higher translation quality than previous approaches that combined signals in an unsupervised fashion (e.g., using minimum reciprocal rank). We also directly compare our model{'}s performance against a sophisticated generative approach, the matching canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) algorithm used by Haghighi et al. (2008). Our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 42{\%} versus MCCA{'}s 15{\%}."

Crowdsourcing is valuable to computational linguists both (a) as a source of labeled training data for use in machine learning and (b) as a means of collecting computational social science data that link language use to underlying beliefs and behavior. We present case studies for both categories: (a) collecting labeled data for use in natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and machine translation and (b) collecting experimental data in the context of psychology; e.g. finding how word use varies with age, sex, personality, health, and happiness. We will also cover tools and techniques for crowdsourcing. Effectively collecting crowdsourced data requires careful attention to the collection process, through selection of appropriately qualified workers, giving clear instructions that are understandable to non-?experts, and performing quality control on the results to eliminate spammers who complete tasks randomly or carelessly in order to collect the small financial reward.

The second measure enumerates paraphrase rules from the monolingual parallel corpus and calculates the overlap between this reference paraphrase collection and the paraphrase resource being evaluated.

In this work, we use an additional data resource, comparable corpora, to improve both. Beginning with a small bitext and corresponding phrase-based SMT model, we improve coverage by using bilingual lexicon induction techniques to learn new translations from comparable corpora. Then, we supplement the modelxe2x80x99s feature space with translation scores estimated over comparable corpora in order to improve accuracy.

There are excellent pedagogical texts, but problems in MT and current algorithms for solving them are best learned by doing. As a centerpiece of our MT course, we devised a series of open-ended challenges for students in which the goal was to improve performance on carefully constrained instances of four key MT tasks: alignment, decoding, evaluation, and reranking. Students brought a diverse set of techniques to the problems, including some novel solutions which performed remarkably well. A surprising and exciting outcome was that student solutions or their combinations fared competitively on some tasks, demonstrating that even newcomers to the field can help improve the state-of-the-art on hard NLP problems while simultaneously learning a great deal.

Even in a low resource machine translation setting, where induced translations have the potential to improve performance substantially, it is reasonable to assume access to some amount of data to perform this kind of optimization. Our work shows that only a few hundred translation pairs are needed to achieve strong performance on the bilingual lexicon induction task, and our approach yields an average relative gain in accuracy of nearly 50% over an unsupervised baseline.

We investigate these assumptions, along with other questions of word sense, by looking at sampled parallel sentences containing tokens of the same type in English, asking how often they mean the same thing when they are: 1. aligned to the same foreign type; and 2. aligned to different foreign types. Results for French-English and Chinese-English parallel corpora show similar behavior: Synonymy is only very weakly the more prevalent scenario, where both cases regularly occur."

We describe a new modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, the creation of a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation), and a holder (an experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set.n n We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations. Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. Although the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described here. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic and semantic information can improve translation quality."

Our method only requires monolingual corpora in source and target languages, a small bilingual dictionary, and a small bitext for tuning feature weights.

We examine the degradation in translation performance when bilingually estimated translation probabilities are removed and show that 80% of the loss can be recovered with monolingually estimated features alone.

The results also show that monolingual distribution similarity can serve as a threshold for high precision paraphrase selection.

Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input. This requirement makes it difficult to incorporate them into phrase-based translation, which generates partial hypothesized translations from left-to-right. Incremental syntactic language models score sentences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are therefore a good mechanism for incorporating syntax into phrase-based translation. We give a formal definition of one such lineartime syntactic language model, detail its relation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate the model with the Moses phrase-based translation system.

We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of residence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (optionally) calibration against professional translators. Using these features to score the collected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable translations.

As MT becomes increasingly desired for more and more language pairs and more and more domains, it becomes necessary to build test sets for each case. In this paper, we investigate using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to make MT test sets cheaply. We find that MTurk can be used to make test sets much cheaper than professionally-produced test sets. More importantly, in experiments with multiple MT systems, we find that the MTurk-produced test sets yield essentially the same conclusions regarding system performance as the professionally-produced test sets yield."

While previous work demonstrated that redundant transcription can improve data quality, we found that resources are better spent collecting more data. Finally, we describe a quality control method without needing professional transcription."

However, human judgment still plays a large role in the context of evaluating MT systems. For example, the GALE project uses human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER), wherein the MT output is scored against a post-edited version of itself (as opposed to being scored against an existing human reference). This poses a problem for MT researchers, since HTER is not an easy metric to calculate, and would require hiring and training human an-notators to perform the editing task. In this work, we explore soliciting those edits from untrained human annotators, via the online service Amazon Mechanical Turk. We show that the collected data allows us to predict HTER-ranking of documents at a significantly higher level than the ranking obtained using automatic metrics."

Since frequent batch retraining is computationally demanding we introduce a fast incremental alternative using an online version of the EM algorithm. To bound our memory requirements we use a novel data-structure and associated training regime. When compared to frequent batch retraining, our online time and space-bounded model achieves the same performance with significantly less computational overhead."

We also present an analysis of the types of errors that the systems make. Our analyses are particularly valuable for building machine translation systems for low resource languages, where creating and integrating a transliteration module for a language with few NLP resources may provide substantial gains in translation performance."

The method is best when the system will eventually be evaluated using the same metric, but in reality, most MT evaluations have a human-based component. Although performing MERT with a human-based metric seems like a daunting task, we describe a new metric, Rypt, which takes human judgments into account, but only requires human input to build a database that can be reused over and over again, hence eliminating the need for human input at tuning time. In this investigative study, we analyze the diversity (or lack thereof) of the candidates produced during MERT, we describe how this redundancy can be used to our advantage, and show that Rypt is a better predictor of translation quality than Bleu."

Augmenting the training data with paraphrases generated by pivoting through other languages alleviates this problem, especially for the so-called low density languages. But pivoting requires additional parallel texts. We address this problem by deriving paraphrases monolingually, using distributional semantic similarity measures, thus providing access to larger training resources, such as comparable and unrelated monolingual corpora. We present what is to our knowledge the first successful integration of a collocational approach to untranslated words with an end-to-end, state of the art SMT system demonstrating significant translation improvements in a low-resource setting."

We use the psuedo inverse of the Laplacian to derive estimates for commute times in graphs. Further, we show that this pseudo inverse based measure could be improved by discarding the least significant eigenvectors, corresponding to the noise in the graph construction process, using singular value decomposition."
