It inserts “holes” in the standard convolution map to increase the reception field. The hole-structure brings a breakthrough improvement to the semantic segmentation task. Similarly, several hole-structured convolution neural networks (CNNs) (Lei et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017) are designed to handle natural language processing tasks. In the text, there exists noncontinuous semantic where useless information may be interspersed among the sentences. Holes in the dilated convolution can ignore the extra word between the non-continuous words and well adapt to match non-continuous semantic.

Code Hierarchy: Based on ICD taxonomy, ICD codes are organized under a tree-like hierarchical structure as shown in Figure 2, which indicates the parent-child and sibling relations between codes. In the hierarchical structure, the upper level nodes represent more generic disease categories and the lower level nodes represent more specific diseases. The code hierarchy can capture the mutual exclusion of some codes. If code X and Y are both children of Z (i.e., X and Y are the siblings), it is unlikely to simultaneously assign X and Y to a patient in general (Xie and Xing, 2018). For example in Figure 2, if code “464.00 (acute laryngitis without mention of obstruction)” is assigned to a patient, it is unlikely to assign the code “464.01 (acute laryngitis with obstruction)” to the patient at the same time. If automatic ICD coding models ignore such a characteristic, they are prone to giving inconsistent predictions. Thus, a challenging problem is how to model the code hierarchy and use it to capture the mutual exclusion of codes.

Second, it is difficult to correctly assign proper codes to the input document even for professional coders, because one document can be assigned multiple ICD codes and the number of codes in the taxonomy of ICD is large. For example, there are over 15,000 and 60,000 codes respectively in the ninth version (ICD-9) and the tenth version (ICD-10) of ICD taxonomies. To reduce human labor and coding errors, many methods have been carefully designed for automatic ICD coding (Perotte et al., 2013; Mullenbach et al., 2018). For example in Figure 1, given the clinical text of a patient, the ICD coding model needs to automatically predict the corresponding ICD codes. The automatic ICD coding task can be modeled as a multi-label classification task since each clinical text is usually accompanied by mul3105 Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3105–3114 c July 5 - 10, 2020. 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics ICD-9 Descriptor Hierarchical Structure 460-519 - DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 460-519 460 - Acute nasopharyngitis 461 - Acute sinusit"

Most of the previous methods handle each code in isolation and convert the multi-label problem into a set of binary classification problems to predict whether each code of interest presents or not (Mullenbach et al., 2018; Rios and Kavuluru, 2018). Though effective, they ignore two important characteristics: Code Hierarchy and Code Co-occurrence, which can be leveraged to improve coding accuracy. In the following, we will introduce the two characteristics and the reasons why they are critical for the automatic ICD coding. Code Hierarchy: Based on ICD taxonomy, ICD codes are organized under a tree-like hierarchical structure as shown in Figure 2, which indicates the parent-child and sibling relations between codes. In the hierarchical structure, the upper level nodes represent more generic disease categories and the lower level nodes re"

We select cardiology topic consultations, since there are more inquiries, while dialogues of other topics often depend more on tests. A typical consultation dialogue is illustrated in Figure 1. The principle of the annotation is to label useful information as comprehensive as possible. A commonly utilized annotation paradigm is sequential labeling, where the medical entities are labeled using BIO tags (Du et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019; Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015; Ma and Hovy, 2016). However, such annotation methods cannot label information that a) expressed by multiple turns and b) not explicitly or not consecutively expressed. Such situations are not rare in spoken dialogues, as can be seen in Figure 1. To this end, we use a window-to-information annotation method instead of sequential labeling. As listed in Table 1, we define four main categories, and for each category, we further define frequent items. The item quantity of symptom, surgery, test and other info is 45, 4, 16 and 6, respectively. In medical dialogues, status is quite The most similar work to ours is (Li"

The feature-based methods can extract the feature of the relation between discourses. However, these methods do not deal well with the implicit instances which lack explicit features. For CED, as shown in Figure 1, D2 lacks explicit features such as because of, due to, or the features of tenses, which are not friendly for feature-based methods. The methods based on neural network are mainly Tree-LSTM model (Wang et al., 2017) and hierarchical Bi-LSTM model (Son et al., 2018). The Tree-LSTM models learn the relations between words to capture the semantics of discourses more accurately but lack further understanding of the semantics between discourses. The hierarchical Bi-LSTM models can employ sequence structure to implicitly learn the relations between words and discourses. However, previous work shows that compared with Tree-LSTM, Bi-LSTM lacks a direct understanding of the dependency relations between words.

Take the sentence “南京市长江大桥 (Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge)” for example, it is more complicated than the sentence in Figure 1 because it is prone to be misunderstood as “南京市长/江大桥 (The mayor of Nanjing is Jiang Daqiao)”. Thus, it needs more reasoning passes to learn the lexical knowledge for recognizing the entity “长江大桥 (Yangtze River Bridge)” than the entity “北海道 (Hokkaido)” in Figure 1. However, if the reasoning passes are too many, the performance will decrease in word sense disambiguation task (Luo et al., 2018). We argue that the problem also exists in Chinese NER task.

Another issue is that most of the existing methods cannot efficiently capture tag dependencies. In sequence labeling neural network models, CRF is usually used as a decoding layer.

Recent improvements of distant supervision have been proven to be effective to label training data for some tasks, such as relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009), event detection (Chen et al., 2017), and so on. Therefore, we investigate a distant data augmentation framework for solving the data lacking problem on the ECD task, dubbed as Knowledge Enhanced Distant Data Augmentation (KnowDis), to automatically label available data. We argue that a sentence contains an event pair with a high probability of causality and expresses its causal semantic can be labeled as training data for the ECD task.

(2) Causal-TB: This dataset only contains 318 causal links which can further prove effectiveness of the proposed framework for solving the problem of data lacking.

Relational Graph Construction. We first organize dialogue contexts as a “relational graph”, where the nodes correspond to words in D, and the edges reflect their relationships. We consider two types of relationships: 1) co-reference knowledge (Chen et al., 2017), which designates expressions referring to the same entity, and 2) relation knowledge (Yu et al., 2020), which reflects semantic relations between two entities (We refer to § 4.1 for how we obtain such knowledge). A heterogeneous graph is proposed to model the knowledge, which uses different types of edges to indicate different types of knowledge. We also add self-loop edges in the graph to facilitate effective computation (Schlichtkrull et al., 2017). Thus, the total number of different types of edges is 1 + 1 + Nr (self-loop + co-reference + number of semantic relation). Knowledge Integrati"

In this section, we explore a simple way of representing relations with the deep transformers model. The model architecture is shown in Figure 1 and the details are as follows: Firstly, we construct the input sequence s = {w0 , w1 , ..., wn }, where w0 = [CLS] and wn = [SEP] are special start and end markers. Next, to ensure generalization of the model, we follow previous studies (He et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Chauhan et al., 2019) to perform entity blinding on the sequence, where the words in the sequence matching the entity are replaced with the target entity label. Then, in order to highlight entity mentions, we augment the sequence with four reserved word pieces, i.e., he1i,h/e1i,he2i and h/e2i, to mark the begin and end of each entity mention. After that, we get the prepared sequence sˆ. sˆ ={[CLS], w1 , ..., wi−2 , he1i, wi , ..., wj , h/e1i, ..., he2i, wk , ..., wl , h/e2i, ..., wm−2 , [SEP]} Given the prepared sequence sˆ as input, the output of BERT is expressed as H ∈ Rm×d , where m is the prepared sequence le"

Each center node of Atomic is an event like “PersonX’s face is covered in blood”, and the nodes associated with it are the cause, the effect, and the attribute of the roles of the events. Therefore, Atomic is beneficial for the machine to know “what happens”. Secondly, we utilize a structured description to restore the scene. Specifically, we build a scene graph based on the original narrative and the knowledge from Atomic. Compared with the unstructured text, graph data can represent the scene more intuitively. In MRC task, previous works (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Qiu et al., 2019) that utilize structured data generally regard the words or noun phrases as the nodes of the graph. Those methods have no specific for Narrative MRC, where the events and the roles are the key factors. Therefore, we build the scene graph by taking the events, the persons, and the external knowledge of the event as the nodes. Meanwhile, we design the connections of the graph from both the perspectives of each event and the whole passage. Instead of the typical plane graph, we build a threedimensional graph, which can not only model the relevance among the events in the passage but also retain t"

For better understanding, we show the memory states after learning Attack and Meet, respectively. to a word that most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event. Event arguments are participants of the event. Event mention refers to a phrase or sentence within which an event is described. Given a sentence or document, an ED system aims to locate event triggers and categorize their types. For example, in the sentence “A man died in the hospital”, an ED system is expected to detect a Die event along with the trigger word “died”. Following previous work (Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018a), we formulate ED as a token-level multi-class classification task. Namely, given a sentence, we treat every token in it as a trigger candidate, and we aim to classify each candidate into pre-defined event classes. In real world, new event classes continually occur. Therefore, a practical ED system should enable to incrementally learn new event classes. We introduce a new problem, incremental event detection. Suppose that there a class-incremental data stream, denoted as {X (1) , X (2) , . . . , X (M ) }. Each X (k)1 contains training/validation/testing"

When new classes arrive, the stored data and new data are combined to re-train the model (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2018, 2019). Since replay-based methods are very simple and effective, such methods have dominated the research. However, when applying replay-based methods to incremental event detection, we find two challenges: 1) Semantic Ambiguity problem and 2) Class Imbalance problem. Semantic Ambiguity: Compared with simple image classification task, event detection has more serious ambiguity problem (Chen et al., 2018). For example, in the sentence “He left the company”, the word “left” can not only trigger End-Position event, but also trigger Transport event. By contrast, the example “He resigned his position as manager” can more accurately express End-Position event and is more representative for the End-Position class. The ambiguous examples could confuse the classifier, affecting the generalization ability (Liu et al., 2014). It indicates that re-training the model with ambiguous old examples isn’t conducive to retaining previous knowledge. Therefore, to alleviate semantic ambiguity, we need to reserve"

In general, X (k) can contain one or more new classes. 709 3.1 Trigger Extractor Our trigger extractor is based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).

In parameter-based methods, these methods try to identify and preserve significant parameters of the original model (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018). However, it is difficult to design a reasonable metric to evaluate all the parameters. In replay-based methods, these methods preserve the previous knowledge via storing a small number of old data (Castro et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a; Han et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2019a) propose an episodic memory replay (EMR) method which randomly selects examples to reserve in a memory. Despite the effectiveness of these methods on image classification tasks, these methods cannot handle semantic ambiguity problem and class imbalance problem in incremental event detection. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce incremental learning into event detection and propose a knowledge consolidation network to preserve previously learned knowledge.

Therefore, we propose the following construction method: for a given event detection dataset, the classes are arranged in a fixed order. Each method is then trained in a class-incremental way on the available training data. Based on two widely used datasets, ACE 20053 and TAC KBP 20174 , we introduce two instantiations of the above construction method. 1) ACE benchmark: We use the dataset split of ACE dataset as suggested in (Li et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). Since the ACE dataset has long-tail frequency distribution, we exploit the data of the top 10 most frequent classes. 2) TAC KBP benchmark: We exploit the official training and testing data of TAC KBP. Same as the ACE benchmark, we also use the data of the top 10 most frequent classes.

For this target, information extraction (IE) is an effective method, which aims to extract entity, relation, event, and other factual information from raw texts and link them to KBs. With the rapid development of IE area, a few remarkable open-source toolkits have been developed in recent years. The mainstream toolkits can be classified into two categories: task-specific toolkits and task-agnostic toolkits. Task-specific toolkits focus on one or a few specific tasks, such as FLAIR (Akbik et al., 2019) for named entity recognition (NER), BLINK (Ledell Wu, 2020) for entity linking (EL), OpenNRE (Han et al., 2019) for relation extraction (RE) and Open-SESAME (Swayamdipta et al., 2017) for frame-semantic parsing. On the other end of the spectrum, AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017), OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) and other task-agnostic toolkits are designed to provide programming framework without the implementation of specific tasks.

Wang et al. (2021) divide KBs into three categories according to the type of knowledge, respectively linguistic KBs (e.g., FrameNet), world KBs (e.g., DBpedia, Wikidata) and commonsense KBs (e.g., ConceptNet).

As shown in Figure 2, we give some examples to illustrate these functions. 3.1 Entity Linking Event Extraction Events are classified as things that happen or occur, and usually involve entities as their properties. Event extraction need to identify events that are composed of an event trigger, an event type, and a set of arguments with different roles. To achieve the function of event extraction, we realize DMCNN (Chen et al., 2015) and a joint model based on BERT. 3.6 Entity Typing Frame-Semantic Parsing Frame semantic parsing is the task of automatically extracting semantic structures in plain texts according the framework of FrameNet. Each frame represents a kind of event, situation, or relationship, and consists of a frame name, a list of lexical units (LUs), and a set of frame elements (FEs). LU is a word that plays the role of evoking the corresponding frame. FE indicates different semantic roles associated with the frame.

More specifically, after identifying entity mentions in texts, the main goal of RE is to classify relations. To achieve the function of relation extraction, we adopt BERT as the textual encoder and use FFN as the decoder. As CogIE implements relation extraction simultaneously, it also matches extracted relations to Wikidata in the form as shown in Figure 2. We train relation matching on T-REx (Elsahar et al., 2018), which is a large-scale alignment dataset between free text documents and KB triples, there are currently 500 relation classes in CogIE.

Introduction The detection of model robustness has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, given that deep neural networks (DNNs) of high accuracy can still be vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial examples (Li et al., 2020), distribution shift (Miller et al., 2020), data transformation (Xing et al., 2020), and shortcut learning (Geirhos et al., 2020). Existing approaches to textual robustness evaluation focus on slightly modifying the input data, which maintains the original meaning and results in a different prediction.

NER plays a crucial role in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003), question answering (Moll´a et al., 2006) and summarization (Aramaki et al., 2009). Most of the research on NER, such as Lample et al. (2016); Ma and Hovy (2016); Chiu and Nichols (2016), only relies on the textual modality to infer tags. However, when texts are noisy or short, and it is not sufficient to locate and classify named entities accurately only based on textual information (Baldwin et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018). One promising solution is to introduce other modalities as the supplement of the textual modality. So far, some studies on multimodal NER, such as Moon et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2018); Lu et al. (2018); Arshad et al. (2019); Asgari-Chenaghlu et al. (2020); Yu et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2020); Sun et al. (2020), have attempted to couple the textual moda"

Then, we compare our corpus with several widely used nested NER datasets, like GENIA (Kim et al., 2003), JNLPBA (Collier and Kim, 2004), ACE-2004 (Doddington et al., 2004) and ACE-2005 (Walker et al., 2004).

From Table 2, we observe that our corpus has unique value compared with the existing datasets. The value is reflected in the following aspects: (1) CNERTA is a large-scale dataset; (2) CNERTA is the first Chinese multimodal dataset; (3) Not only the topmost entities but also nested entities are annotated; (4) Among these datasets, the acoustic modality is only introduced in CNERTA"

PLM-CRF: Instead of training a model from scratch, we also adopt the framework of fine-tuning a pretrained language model (PLM) on a downstream task (Radford et al., 2018). In this framework, we adopt BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) as the textual encoder and use CRF as the decoder. In addition to initializing the textual encoder with the original pretrained BERT model, a SoTA Chinese pretrained language model, called MacBERT (Cui et al., 2020), is used. Compared with BERT, MacBERT is built upon RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and the original MLM task in BERT is replaced with the MLM as correction task. For more details, we refer readers to Cui et al.

Fortunately, cues contained in the fluent acoustic modality, especially pauses between adjacent words, are able to aid the NER model in discovering word boundaries. A classic example shown in Figure 1 can perfectly illustrate this point. In this example, the sentence with ambiguous word segmentation would be disambiguated with the aid of the acoustic modality, which would absolutely assist the model to infer correct NER tags. In this work, we make the following efforts to advance multimodal NER: CRF (Devlin et al., 2019).

Then, since introducing a lexicon has been proven as an effective way to incorporate word information in Chinese NER (Zhang and Yang, 2018), we implement several lexicon-enhanced models, such as Lattice-LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018) and ZEN (Diao et al., 2020), to explore whether the acoustic modality can provide word information beyond the lexicon. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of introducing the acoustic modality, we test some widely used multimodal models, such as CMA (Tsai et al., 2019) and MMI (Yu et al., 2020), on our dataset. Third, upon these strong baselines, we further propose a simple Multi-Modal Multi-Task model (short for M3T) to make better use of the pause information in the acoustic modality.

However, most of the NLP-related augmentation methods are a task-independent framework that produces new data at one time (Zhang et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019b). In these frameworks, data augmentation and target task are modeled independently. This often leads to a lack of task-related characteristics in the generated data, such as taskrelated linguistic expression and knowledge. For example, easy data augmentation (EDA) (Wei and Zou, 2019) is the most representative method that relies on lexical substitution, deletion, swapping, and insertion to produce new data. However, solely relying on such word operations often generates new data that dissatisfies task-related qualities. As shown in Figure 1, S3 is produced by EDA, it lacks a linguistic expression that expresses the causal semantics between kill and attack.

However, including the distant supervision, most of the existing data augmentation methods for NLP tasks are task-independent frameworks (Related work of data augmentation and dual learning are detailed in Appendix B).

We enhance the matching approach with some rules, such as soft matching with lemmatization and filtering of stop words. The grounded concept is called zero-hop concept. Then, our method grows zero-hop concept with one-hop concepts. The zero-hop concept, one-hop concepts and all relations between them form the descriptive graph for e1 (denoted as Gd1 ). (2) If the descriptive knowledge cannot be retrieved from the KB, we adopt the generation method. Our method employs the pre-trained model, COMET (Bosselut et al., 2019), which is originally proposed for the knowledge base completion. Specifically, COMET is obtained by finetuning GPT (Radford et al., 2018) on C ONCEPTN ET. The input of COMET is the head event and candidate relation, and the output is the tail event. The relation types are the same as the ones used in Bosselut et al. (2019). By leveraging COMET, we can generate the descriptive graph Gd1 for e1 . In the same way, we can also construct the descriptive graph Gd2 for e2 . 3.2.2 Knowledge Encoding Graph neural networks have been widely used to encode graph-structured data (Lin et al., 2019; Yang et"

Identifying event causal relation is inherently challenging, because event causality is usually expressed in diverse forms that often lack explicit clues indicating its existence. For example in Figure 1, the sentence has no explicit clue indicating the causal relation between “global warming” and “tsunami”. In this scenario, models can resort to a large amount of labeled data to learn diverse causal expressions. However, existing ECI datasets are very small. For example, the largest dataset EventStoryLine (Caselli and Vossen, 2017) only contains 258 documents, which is not sufficient to train neural network models (Liu et al., 2020). Consequently, models cannot thoroughly understand the text and possibly make a wrong prediction. Nonetheless, humans could make a correct judgement, because humans have the background knowledge about the two events. To be more specific, humans not only know what the two events are, but also know the connection between them.

Introduction Event causality identification (ECI) aims to identify causal relation of events in texts. For example, in the sentence “The earthquake generated a tsunami.”, an ECI model should be able to identify a causal relationship that holds between the two cause mentioned events, i.e., earthquake −−−→ tsunami. ECI is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) area and can support many NLP applications, such as machine reading comprehension (Berant et al., 2014), process extraction (Thalappillil Scaria et al., 2013) and future event prediction (Radinsky et al., 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2014). Identifying event causal relation is inherently challenging, because event causality is usually expressed in diverse forms that often lack explicit clues indicating its existence. For example in Figure 1, the sentence has no explicit clue indicating the causal relation between “global warming” and “tsunami”. In this scenario, models can resort to a large amount of labeled data to learn diverse causal expressions. However, existing ECI datasets are very small. For example, the largest dataset EventStoryLine (Caselli a"

If the model can make use of such knowledge, it is obvious that the model can better understand the meaning of the event itself than using only the given text. Therefore, incorporating the descriptive knowledge is very helpful for this task. However, when leveraging this kind of knowledge, we find two critical challenges: (1) As shown in Figure 1, the descriptive knowledge forms a sub-graph. How to effectively encode the graph-structured knowledge is a very challenging problem; (2) The knowledge base is incomplete (Wang et al., 2020), which will inevitably cause the descriptive knowledge of some events cannot be obtained from the KB. Thus, the model should have the ability to obtain and encode such knowledge, even if it does not exist in the KB. Relational Knowledge: The external knowledge base contains connections between events, which can be referred as the relational knowledge between events. It is usually defined by the multi-hop path between two events. This kind of knowledge can provide useful information for event causality reasoning, especially when the text lacks causal clues.

A REC is flexible to apply on any co-attention architectures, allowing us for deep investigations of well-trained models. With the proposed A REC, we study three typical co-attention based models Decomposable Attention (DA) (Parikh et al., 2016), Enhanced LSTM (ESIM) (Chen et al., 2017) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) on four benchmarks including SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), ESNLI (Camburu et al., 2018), BNLI (Glockner et al., 2018) and HANS (McCoy et al., 2019). Experimental results show that our method could generate more faithful and readable explanations. Moreover, we employ our proposed A REC to analyze these models deeply from the aspect of alignments. Based on our explanations, we further present a simple improvement strategy that greatly increases robustness of different models without modifying their architectures or retraining. This proves that our method could factually reflect how models work. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1) We come up with A REC, a post-hoc local explanation method to extract"

For the example in Figure 1, the contradicted phrase pair street – store is one of the key alignments responsible for the correct prediction. To explain NLI models over alignments, the literature usually looks at co-attention weights (Parikh et al., 2016; Pang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017), which is a dominant way to implicitly align word pairs (Wang et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). However, attention is argued not as explainable as expected (Jain and Wallace, 2019; Serrano and Smith, 2019; Bastings and Filippova, 2020). Moreover, co-attention assigns scores among words thus forbids us to observe phraselevel alignments, which is a flaw that generally exists for attribution explanations as shown in Figure 1 (c). Other works build hard alignments resorting sparse attention (Yu et al., 2019; Bastings et al., 2019; Swanson et al., 2020).

We obtain the following findings: 7 We don’t use Area Over Perturbation Curve (AOPC) (DeYoung et al., 2020) because our method is to reserve features (i.e., alignments) that keep the prediction, it is fitter to utilize reservation curve. 8 Both annotators are well-educated postgraduates major in computer science. We conduct human evaluation on randomly sampled 300 examples in SNLI testing set. 9 The threshold is set to L0 + 0.1 of A REC to obtain alignment rationales with similar fidelity for fair comparison. We don’t use fix size constraint to construct rationales as done in Jain et al. (2020) because we think the size of a rationale depends on the instance. 1) A REC is quite faithful with the lowest AORC and fidelity value in most cases. Perturbation-based methods are equally matched with moderate performances, while gradient-based ones have the least faithfulness. Surprisingly, co-attention is a very strong baseline to indicate important alignments for NLI, surpassing most other baselines on AORC, extremely for ESIM. This result is of accordance with Vashishth et al. (2019) that attention is more faithful in cross-sentence tasks compared with singlesentence tasks. 2) A REC is qui"

The multi-events problem requires the DEE method to recognize how many events are contained in a document and achieve accurate arguments assembling (i.e., assign arguments to the corresponding event). As a result of these two complications, SEE methods are ill-suited for the DEE task, which calls for a model that can integrate document-level information, assemble relevant arguments across multiple sentences and capture multiple events simultaneously. To handle these challenges in DEE, previous works (Yang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019) formulate DEE as an event table filling task, i.e., filling candidate arguments into a predefined event table. Specifically, they model the DEE as a serial prediction paradigm, in which arguments are predicted in a predefined role order and multiple events are also extracted in predefined event order. Such a manner is restricted to the extraction of individual arguments, and the former extraction will not consider the latter extraction results. As a result, errors will be propagated and the extraction performance is under satisfaction. In this paper, to avoid the shortage"

A two-step approach (Zhang et al., 2020) is proposed for argument linking by detecting implicit argument across sentences. Li et al. (2021) extend this task and compile a new benchmark dataset 6305 WIKIEVENTS for exploring document-level argument extraction task. Then, Li et al. (2021) propose an end-to-end neural event argument extraction model by conditional text generation. However, these works focused on the sub-task of DEE (i.e., role filler extraction or argument extraction) and ignored the challenge of multi-events. To simultaneously address both challenges for DEE (i.e., arguments-scattering and multi-events), previous works"

The selected baselines are as followed (see more details in Appendix C): Regular Expressions (RegExp): In this setting, we regard the FinReason task as a causal sentence detection problem and employ some ad-hoc regular expressions to solve it. Specifically, we use five modifiers (因为(because),由于(since),原 因(cause),为(in order to),目的(aims to)) as causal clues to detect the sentence as the reasons for an event. BiLSTM-CRF (BiLSTM): We can take the reasons as one part of the event description and regard the task as an EE task. Similar to Yang et al. (2018), we employ a BiLSTM-CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016) to predict the start and end positions of each reason. Specifically, We simply get the event participants in the documents via string matching between the documents and the given structural events. Such information is used as features in a BIO tagging format. BERT-QA: We can take this task as an MRC problem if the structural event is regarded as a query and the target reason as the answer.

KPN consists of two core components, i.e., multi-prototype enhanced retrospection and multistrategy knowledge distillation, for dealing with the two main challenges, i.e., expression diversity and combinatorial explosion. The framework of KPN is shown in Figure 3. In each dialogue turn, SOM-DST simplifies the dialogue history to the last system response and the last dialogue state, and then combines them with the current user utterance into an input sequence for the BERT encoder (Devlin et al., 2019). BERT is a multi-layer Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled corpora. To fit the input form of BERT, the tokens [CLS] and [SEP] are placed in the input sequence. In addition, a special token [SLOT] is placed at the beginning of each slot in the last dialogue state. The BERT encoder obtains the contextual representation for the input sequence. The encoded hidden state of [SLOT] is used as the feature vector of each slot. For each slot, SOM-DST first classifies it into four categories, including “dontcare”, “carryover”, “update”, and “delete”. “dontcare” means"

Our method handles the domain-lifelong learning problem, where data of new domains continually arrives, whether it is new single-domain or new multi-domain data. 5.2 4.6 Discussion: Memory Capacity Lifelong Learning Lifelong learning, also called continual learning, is a long-standing research topic in machine learning, which enables models to perform online learning on new data (Cauwenberghs and Poggio, 2000; Kuzborskij et al., 2013). Architecture-based methods dynamically extend the model architecture to learn new data (Fernando et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019). However, the model size grows rapidly with the increase of new data, which limits the application of architecture-based methods. Existing lifelong learning methods can be divided into two main categories: regularization-based methods (Zenke et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018) and replay-based methods (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2019). Regularization-based methods design reasonable 5 Related Work metrics to identify the parameters important to old 5.1 Dialogue State Tracking data and slow down the update of them (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Li and Hoiem, 2017).

Pretrained static and contextual word representations can provide valuable prior knowledge for constructing relational representations (Soares et al., 2019; Elsahar et al., 2017). Peters et al. (2018) showed that different neural architectures (e.g., LSTM, CNN, and Transformers) can hierarchically structure linguistic information that varies with network depth. Recently, many studies (Jawahar et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Goldberg, 2019) have shown that such hierarchy also exists in pretraining models like BERT.

This method can capture some contextual information in modeling the translation of phrases as a whole.

For phrase-based translation model described in (Zhou et al., 2011), we employ Moses toolkit10 to extract the phrase translation and set the maximum length of phrases to 5. Recently, Singh (2012) extended the word-based translation model and explored strategies to learn the translation probabilities between words and the concepts using the CQA archives and a popular entity catalog. However, these existing studies in the literature are basically monolingual translation, which are restricted to the use of the original language of the CQA archives, without taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages.

From Table 2, we can see that our method outperforms co-occurrence-based methods AdjRule and LRTBOOT, but achieves comparable or a little worse results than syntax-based methods DP and DPHITS. This is because CRD is quite small, which only contains several hundred sentences for each product review set. In this case, methods based on careful-designed syntax rules have superiority over those based on statistics (Liu et al., 2013). For results on larger datasets shown in Table 3, our method outperforms all of the competitors. Comparing OCDNN with DP-HITS, the two approaches use similar term ranking metrics (Eq. 7 and Eq. 8), but OCDNN significantly outperforms DP-HITS. Therefore, the positive proportion score estimated by OCDNN is more effective than the importance score in DP-HITS. Comparing OCDNN with LRTBOOT, we find that LRTBOOT achieves better recall but lower precision. This is because LRTBOOT follows Assumption 1 during bootstrapping, which suffers a lot from error propagation, while our joint classification app"

For a valid opinion relation, there are three requirements corresponding to the three factors: (i) the opinion word indicates sentiment polarity; (ii) the opinion target is related to current domain; (iii) the opinion word modifies the opinion target. Previous weakly supervised methods often expand a seed set and identify opinion relation either by co-occurrence statistics (Hu and Liu, 2004; Hai et al., 2012) or syntactic dependencies (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009) following the assumption below. Assumption 1. Terms that are likely to have linking relation with the seed terms are believed to be opinion words or opinion targets. For example, if one has an opinion word seed clear (which satisfies requirement i), and one finds that it modifies the word screen in Example 1 (which satisfies requirement iii). Then one infers that screen is an opinion target according to Assumption 1 (whether screen is correct is not checked). However, in Example 2(a), we can see that good is an opinion word and it modifies thing, but thing is not related to"

The training criterion for word embeddings is, θˆ = argmin θ X X max{0, 1 − sθ (c) + sθ (v)} (2) c∈C v∈Vw where θ is the parameters of neural network used for training. See Collobert et al. (2011) for the detailed implementation. 3.4 Linking Relation Representation by Using Recursive Autoencoder The goal of this section is to represent the linking relation between an opinion word and an opinion target by a n-element vector as we do during word representation. Specifically, we combine embedding vectors of words in a linking relation by a recursive autoencoder (Socher et al., 2011) according to syntactic dependency structure. In this way, linking relations are no longer limited to the initial seeds during classification, because linking relations that are similar to the seed relations will have similar vector representations. Figure 2 shows a linking relation representation process by an example: too loud to listen to the player. First, we get its dependency path between the opinion word cs :loud and the opinion target ct :player. Then cs and ct are replaced by wildcards [SC] and [TC] because they are not concerned in the linking relation. The dash line box in Figure 2"

It takes two n-element vectors as input and compresses semantics of the two vectors into one n-element vector in hidden layer by, 1 y = f (W (dep) [x1 ; x2 ] + b), W (dep) = [I1 ; I2 ; Ib ] +  (3) 2 where [x1 ; x2 ] is the concatenation of the two input vectors and f is the sigmoid function; W (dep) is a parameter matrix that is chosen according to the dependency relation between x1 and x2 (In the case of y1 , W (dep) = W (xcomp) ), which is initialized by Ii , where Ii is a n × n unit matrix, Ib is a n-element null vector, and  is sampled from a uniform distribution U [−0.001, 0.001] (Socher et al., 2013). Then W (dep) are updated during training. The training criterion of autoencoder is to minimize Euclidean distance between the original input and its output, Erae = ||[x1 ; x2 ] − [x01 ; x02 ]||2 T (4) where [x01 ; x02 ] = W (out) y and W (out) is initialized by W (dep) . We always start the combination process from [SC] and it is repeated along the dependency path. For example, the result vector y1 of the first combination is used as the input vector when computing y2 . Finally, the linking relation is represented by a n-element vector (the green vector in Figure 2). 680 3.5 One-Class Classi"

Then, the shortest dependency path between a cs and a ct is taken as a cr . To avoid introducing too many noise candidates, we constrain that there are at most four terms in a cr . 3.3 Word Representation by Word Embedding Learning Word embedding, a.k.a word representation, is a mathematical object associated with each word, which is often used in a vector form, where each dimension’s value corresponds to a feature and might even have a semantic or grammatical interpretation (Turian et al., 2010). By word embedding learning, words are embedded into a hyperspace, where two words that are more semantically similar to each other are located closer. This characteristic is precisely what we want, because the key to one-class classification is semantic similarity measuring (illustrated in Section 3.5). For word representation, we use a matrix LT ∈ Rn×|Vw |, where i-th column represents the embedding vector for term ti , n is the size of embedding vector and Vw is the vocabulary of LT . Therefore, we can denote ti by a binary vector bi ∈ R|Vw |and get its embedding vector by xi = LT bi . The"

We measure LRT between a domain name (e.g. mp3, hotel, etc.) and all opinion target candidates. Then N terms with highest LRT scores are added into the opinion target seed set T S. Linking Relation Seeds. Linking relation can be naturally captured by syntactic dependency, because it directly models the modification relation between opinion word and opinion target. We employ an automatic syntactic opinion pattern learning method called Sentiment Graph Walking (Xu et al., 2013) and get 12 opinion patterns with highest confidence as the linking relation seed set RS. After seed generation, every opinion relation so = (ss , st , sr ) in review corpus that satisfies ss ∈ SS, st ∈ T S and sr ∈ RS is taken as a positive labeled training instance. 3.2 Opinion Relation Candidate Generation The opinion term candidate set is denoted by C = {SC, T C}, where SC/T C represents opinion word/target candidate.

And then, entity mentions Etrain in training corpus are aligned to facts ∆ in Freebase as training examples to train the models. We integrate our fine-grained entity type constraint with MULTIR, an existing multi-instance multilabel extracting model in (Hoffmann et al., 2011). Following their setttings, we conduct experiments on aggregated extraction and sentential extraction to show the effect of fine-grained entity type constraints. • Aggregated extraction: Aggregated extraction is corpus-level extraction.

Instead of manual labeling, it automatically generates training data by aligning facts in existing knowledge bases to text. However, the paradigm of distant supervision also causes new problems of noisy training data both in positive training instances and negative training instances. To overcome the false positive problem caused by the distant supervision assumption, researches in (Riedel et al., 2010)(Hoffmann et al., 2011)(Surdeanu et al., 2012) proposed multi-instance models to model noisy positive training data, where they assumed that at least one sentence in those containing an entity pair is truly positive.

There were a bunch of researches trying to solve the problem of false negative training examples caused by incomplete knowledge bases. Zhang (Zhang et al., 2013) made heuristic rules to filter the false negative training examples. And Xu (Xu et al., 2013) tried to overcom this problem by pseudo-relevance feedback. Min (Min et al., 2013) improved MIML in (Surdeanu et al., 2012) by adding a new layer in their 3-layer graphic model to model the incomplete knowledge base. Ritter (Ritter and Etzioni, 2013) employed similar intuition with (Xu et al., 2013) that they thought rear entities missing in the database would be often mentioned in the text. They proposed a latent-variable approach to model it and showed its improvement over aggregate and sentential extraction. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a novel approach to explore the fine-grained entity type constraints for distantly supervised relation extraction.

One of the promising approaches is semantic parsing (Cai and Yates, 2013; Yih et al., 2015; Yih et al., 2016; Reddy et al., 2016), which uses logic language CCG (zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009; zettlemoyer and Collins, 2012; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Reddy et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015) or DCS (Berant et al., 2013) to map a question to its formal logical form to query on a KB.

A common and effective way to remain only a small subset of facts and entities is to conduct entity linking of a question over KB firstly. There are some work conducting entity linking by searching n-gram words of a question among all entity names (Bordes et al., 2015; Golub and He, 2016). While some other work propose a special-purpose sequence labeling network to focus on more probable candidates in question utterance, then linking them to entities (Dai et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2016b). Previous approaches assume that their preceding steps are correct to produce a good result for next procedure. While it should be pointed out that both the labeling and the entity linking process may lead to error propagation problems. For example, if the previous steps provide a wrong labeling result or don’t recall the gold subject entity in the generated candidates, the following procedure can’t make a good choice to retrieve the gold subject and predicate pair.

Natural language is complex while KB is much more universal. Another challenge is the vast amount of facts in large scale KB. KB is quite large to some extent. KB has a huge number of fact triples and entities. A common and effective way to remain only a small subset of facts and entities is to conduct entity linking of a question over KB firstly. There are some work conducting entity linking by searching n-gram words of a question among all entity names (Bordes et al., 2015; Golub and He, 2016). While some other work propose a special-purpose sequence labeling network to focus on more probable candidates in question utterance, then linking them to entities (Dai et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2016b). Previous approaches assume that their preceding steps are correct to produce a good result for next procedure.

The experiments show that the proposed model is more suitable for Chinese baseNP analysis and the proposed MDLbased algorithm is superior to the traditional MLbased algorithm. The paper also discusses the problem of incorporating the linguistic knowledge into the above statistical model. 1. Introduction The concept of baseNP is initially put forward by Church. In English, baseNP is defined as &apos;simple non-recursive noun phrases&apos;, which means that there is no sub-noun-phrases contained in a baseNP[1]. But the definition can not meet the needs in Chinese information retrieval. The noun phrases such as &quot; n ~ ( n a t u r a l ) ~ ( l a n g u a g e ) ~ - ( p r o c e s s ) &quot; , &quot;~-[E~](Asian) _~[l(finance) :f~ })L(crisis)&quot; and &quot; i ~ ( p o l i t i c a l ) ~fJlJ(system) ~(reformation) ~ ( p r o c e s s ) &quot; are critical for information retrieval, but they are not nonrecursive noun phrases. In Chinese, the attribute of noun phrases can be classified into three types, that is restrictive attributes, distinctive attributes and descriptive attributes, among which the restrictive attributes have aggluti"

[Assumption 1 ] In a Chinese baseNP, if two words x and y can constituent dependency relation, then the head is always the post-positon word y, There are two kinds of structural analysis models for Eng!ish noun phrase, that is adjacency model and dependency model. The research of Lauer shows that the dependency model is superior to the adjacency model for structural analysis of English noun phrase[2]. However, there is no model for structural analysis of Chinese baseNP till now. According to the dependency grammar, two constituents can be bound together they are determined to be dependent. The determination of y z y that isx-*y. According to the Definition 1, there is no preposition phrase, verb phrase, locality phrase or (l~l)-structure in a baseNP, so assumption-I is reasonable.

In this process, several factors, such as word co-occurrence frequencies, word positions 1347 etc., can be considered globally. Compared with adjacent methods, WTM doesn’t identify opinion relations between words in a given window, so long-span relations can be effectively captured (Liu et al., 2009). Compared with syntax-based methods, without using parsing, WTM can effectively avoid errors from parsing informal texts. So it will be more robust. In addition, by using WTM, our method can capture the “one-to-many” or “many-to-one” relations (“one-to-many” means that, in a sentence one opinion word modifies several opinion targets, and “many-to-one” means several opinion words modify one opinion target).

To this end, most previous methods (Hu et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008), named as adjacent methods, employed the adjacent rule, where an opinion target was regarded to have opinion relations with the surrounding opinion words in a given window. However, because of the limitation of window size, opinion relations cannot be captured precisely, especially for long-span relations, which would hurt estimating associations between opinion targets and opinion words. To resolve this problem, several studies exploited syntactic information such as dependency trees (Popescu et al.,"

Thus, our aim is to find potential opinion relations between nouns/noun phrases and adjectives in sentences, and calculate the associations between them. As mentioned in the first section, we formulate opinion relation identification as a word alignment task. We employ the word-based translation model (Brown et al. 1993) to perform monolingual word alignment, which has been widely used in many tasks, such as collocation extraction (Liu et al., 2009), question retrieval (Zhou et al., 2011) and so on. In our method, every sentence is replicated to generate a parallel corpus, and we apply the bilingual word alignment algorithm to the monolingual scenario to align a noun/noun phase with its modifier. n words Given a sentence with S  {w1 , w2 ,..., wn } , the word alignment A  {(i, ai ) |i [1, n]} can be obtained by maximizing the word alignment probability of the sentence as follows.

One common technique for coping with this difficulty is distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) which assumes that if two entities have a relationship in a known knowledge base, then all sentences that mention these two entities will express that relationship in some way. Figure 1 shows an example of the automatic labeling of data through distant supervision. In this example, Apple and Steve Jobs are two related entities in Freebase1 .

To capture structural and other latent information, we divide the convolution results into three segments based on the positions of the two given entities and devise a piecewise max pooling layer instead of the single max pooling layer. The piecewise max pooling procedure returns the maximum value in each segment instead of a single maximum value over the entire sentence.

Many approaches to relation extraction have been developed, such as bootstrapping, unsupervised relation discovery and supervised classification. Supervised approaches are the most commonly used methods for relation 1754 extraction and yield relatively high performance (Bunescu and Mooney, 2006; Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2005). In the supervised paradigm, relation extraction is considered to be a multi-class classification problem and may suffer from a lack of labeled data for training. To address this problem, Mintz et al. (2009) adopted Freebase to perform distant supervision. As described in Section 1, the algorithm for training data generation is sometimes faced with the wrong label problem. To address this shortcoming, (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) developed the relaxed distant supervision assumption for multi-instance learning.

This kind of structures frequently occur in KBs even the formulas are mined with a high confidence, because there are a lot of sparse structures in KBs which will lead to inaccurate confidence. According to our statistics, more than 90 percent of high-confidence formulas produced by random walk are noise. 2) Employing heuristic rules to direct random walks. This method directs random walks to find 1380 useful structures by rewriting the state transition probability matrix, but the artificial heuristic rules may only apply to a little part of formulas. For example, PRA (Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011) assumes the more narrow distributions of elements in a formula are, the higher score the formula will obtain. However, formulas with high scores in PRA are not always true. For example, the formula in Figure 1.c has a high score in PRA, but it is not true. Oppositely, formulas with low scores in PRA are not always useless. For example, the formula, F ather(x, y) ∧ F ather(y, z) ⇒ Grandf ather(x, t), has a low score when x and y both have several sons, but it obviously is the most effective to infer Grandf ather.

In the view of the neural network, our goaldirected mechanism is analogous to the attention mechanism. At each step, the algorithm estimates attentions for each neighboring edges by Ψ. Therefore, there are several existing expressions of Ψ, e.g., the dot product (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) and the single-layer perceptron (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We will not compare different forms of Ψ, the detail comparison has been presented in the work (Luong et al., 2015). We directly employ the simplest dot product for Ψ as follows, Ψ(Er(i,j) , ER(H,T ) ) = σ(Er(i,j) · ER(H,T ) ) (7) where σ is a nonlinear function and we set it as an exponential function. Ψ has no parameters beside KB embeddings which are updated during the training period. 3.3 Integrated Inference Model To handle the dependence between goal-directed random walk and subsequent inference, we combine them into an integrated model and optimize them together.

Such useless formula can be removed by a superrule, which is that the head of a formula cannot occur in its body. 5 Related Work Our work has two aspects, which are related to mining formula automatically and inference on KBs, respectively. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Muggleton and De Raedt, 1994) and Association Rule Mining (ARM) (Agrawal et al., 1993) are both early works on mining formulas. FOIT (Quinlan, 1990) and SHERLOCK (Schoenmackers et al., 2010) are typical ILP systems, but the former one usually need a lot of negative facts and the latter one focuses on mining formulas from text. AMIE (Gal´arraga et al., 2013) is based on ARM and proposes a new measure for formulas instead of the confidence. Several structure learning algorithms (Kok and Domingos, 2005; Kok and Domingos, 2009; Kok and Domingos, 2010) based on Markov Logic Network (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) can also learn first order logic formulas automatically, but they are too slow to run on large KBs.

Event mention: a phrase or sentence within which an event is described, including a trigger and arguments. Given an English text document, an ED system should identify event triggers and categorize their event types for each sentence. For instance, in the sentence “He died in the hospital”, an ED system is expected to detect a Die event along with the trigger word “died”. The ACE 2005 evaluation defines 8 event types and 33 subtypes, such as Attack or Die. Following previous works (Li et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Nguyen and Grishman, 2016), we categorize triggers into these 33 subtypes. 3 Methodology In this paper, we formulate event detection as a sequence labelling task.

The efficiency of our method is studied through extensive experiments on two standard datasets. Empirical results indicate that our method is effective in 1) performing cross-lingual transfer concerning different directions and 2) tackling the extremely annotation-poor scenario. 1 Introduction Event detection (ED) is a crucial natural language processing problem that aims to identify event triggers in texts (Ahn, 2006; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015). For example, in the sentence: “A man died when a tank fired on the hotel”, ED requires a system to identify two event triggers, died and fired, along with their types Die and Attack. Generally, training an ED system requires to obtain a considerably large amount of labeled data. However, owing to the complexity and high costs of annotation, existing event resources are scarce and unbalanced across languages (Hsi et al., 2016), which prevents us from building an ED system in languages with insufficient training data.

Traditionally, the study of ED has focused on monolingual training. The proposed models can be divided into feature-based methods which employ fine-grained features (Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Hong et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Li and Ji, 2014), and deep learning-based methods which employ neural networks to automatically learn features for the task (Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018b; Orr et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019).

The efficiency of our method is studied through extensive experiments on two standard datasets. Empirical results indicate that our method is effective in 1) performing cross-lingual transfer concerning different directions and 2) tackling the extremely annotation-poor scenario. 1 Introduction Event detection (ED) is a crucial natural language processing problem that aims to identify event triggers in texts (Ahn, 2006; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015). For example, in the sentence: “A man died when a tank fired on the hotel”, ED requires a system to identify two event triggers, died and fired, along with their types Die and Attack. Generally, training an ED system requires to obtain a considerably large amount of labeled data. However, owing to the complexity and high costs of annotation, existing event resources are scarce and unbalanced across languages (Hsi et al., 2016), which prevents us from building an ED system in languages with insufficient training data.

There are three main ways to incorporate word information in NER. The first one is the pipeline method. The way of pipeline method is to apply Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) first, and then to use a word-based NER model. However, the pipeline method suffers from error propagation, since the error of CWS may affect the performance of NER. The second one is to learn CWS and NER tasks jointly (Xu et al., 2013; Peng and Dredze, 2016; Cao et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). However, the joint models must rely on CWS annotation datasets, which are costly and are annotated under many diverse segmentation criteria (Chen 3830 Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 3830–3840, c Hong Kong, China, November 3–7, 2019. 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics et al., 2017).

Many works use word segmentation information as extra features for Chinese NER, such as (Peng and Dredze, 2015; He and Sun, 2017a; Zhu and Wang, 2019). Peng and Dredze (2016), Cao et al. (2018) and Wu et al. (2019) propose joint models to train NER together with CWS. Our work is inspired by lattice LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018), which can integrate lexicon in NER. Graph convolutional networks. There are a number of recent graph convolutional network (GCN) architectures (Kipf and Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2019) for learning over graphs.

Therefore, making full use of word information would help to improve the Chinese NER performance. There are three main ways to incorporate word information in NER. The first one is the pipeline method. The way of pipeline method is to apply Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) first, and then to use a word-based NER model. However, the pipeline method suffers from error propagation, since the error of CWS may affect the performance of NER. The second one is to learn CWS and NER tasks jointly (Xu et al., 2013; Peng and Dredze, 2016; Cao et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). However, the joint models must rely on CWS annotation datasets, which are costly and are annotated under many diverse segmentation criteria (Chen 3830 Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 3830–3840, c Hong Kong, China, November 3–7, 2019. 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics et al., 2017).

The third one is to leverage an automatically constructed lexicon, which is pre-trained on large automatically segmented texts. Lexical knowledge includes boundaries and semantic information. Boundaries information is provided by the lexicon word itself, and semantic information is provided by pre-trained word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013). Compared with joint methods, a lexicon is easy to obtain and additional annotation CWS datasets are not required. Recently, Zhang and Yang (2018) propose a lattice LSTM to integrate lexical knowledge in NER. However, integrating lexical knowledge into sentences still faces two challenges. The first challenge is to integrate self-matched lexical words. A self-matched lexical word of a character is the lexical word that contains this character. For instance, “ ¬: ::” (Beijing Airport) and “: : :” (Airport) are the self-matched words of the character “: :” (airplane). “» ” (leave) is not the self-matched word of the character “:” (airplane), since “ :” (airplane) is not contained in the word “ » ” (leave).

The ability of utilizing external knowledge is of great significance in an MRC system (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2017). Latest large-scale datasets, e.g. ReCoRD (Zhang et al., 2018) specify that external knowledge is required to answer questions. Many previous studies have introduced external knowledge in machine comprehension (Weissenborn, 2017; Mihaylov and Frank, 2018; Bauer et al., 2018). They often acquire external knowledge from structural knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and Freebase (Tanon et al., 2016), in which knowledge is organized by triples like “(shortage, related to, lack)” and “(need, related to, lack)”. However, most of them fail to make full use of the structural information in the knowledge graph, and use sequence modeling methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate the representation of knowledge, rather than based on graph structure.

They treat retrieved knowledge triples as sequences and use sequence modeling methods to compress the representation of knowledge, which are not based on graph structure. On the contrary, we organize knowledge as sub-graphs, then update the representation of nodes on sub-graphs with graph neural network. Graph Neural Netwoks Graph neural netwoks (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017) have been shown successful on many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (Cao et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2019). They are good at dealing with graphstructured data. In (Cao et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2019), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been applied in multidocumnent machine comprehension for multi-hop reasoning question answering, but they consider only the internal structure information in the MRC context without incorporating external knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study graph attention networks in machine comprehension with external knowledge. 3 SKG Model The architecture of SKG is shown in Figure 1.

Similarly, the models for Chinese NER can also be divided into two categories: Individual Model and Integrated Model. Individual Model[Chen, et al. 1998][Sun, et al. 1994][Zheng, et al. 2000] consists of several submodels, each of them deals with a kind of entities. For example, the recognition of PN may be statistical-based model, while LN and ON may be rulebased model like [Chen, et al. 1998]. Integrated Model[Sun, et al. 2002] [Zhang, et al. 2003][Yu, et al. 1998][Chua, et al. 2002] deals with all kinds of 428 entities in a unified statistical framework. Most of these integrated models can be viewed as a HMM model. The differences among them are the definition of state and the features used in entity model and context model. In fact, a NER model recognizes named entities through mining the intrinsic features in the entities and the contextual features around the entities. Most of existing approaches employ either coarse particle features, like POS and ROLE[Zhang, et al. 2003], or fine particle features like word."

(2008) introduced lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method. Our approach is similar to theirs in that we used the fine-grained feature generation scheme based on HowNet hierarchical semantic knowledge, and the fine-grained features can be viewed as being a kind of “back-off” version of the baseline features. However, we focus on the problem of POS representation instead of lexical representation. Recently, there are some studies focusing on parsing task using semantic knowledge. Agirre et al.

The discriminative parser we used in this paper is based on the part-factored model and features of the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007). The parsing model can be defined as a conditional distribution p(y|x; w) over each projective parse tree y for a particular sentence x, parameterized by a vector w. The probability of a parse tree is {∑ } 1 exp w·Φ(x, ρ) (1) p(y|x; w) = Z(x; w) ρ∈y where Z(x; w) is the partition function and Φ are part-factored feature functions that include headmodifier parts, sibling parts and grandchild parts.

To solve the lexical gap problem, most researchers regarded the question retrieval task as a statistical machine translation problem by using IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) to learn the wordto-word translation probabilities (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Jeon et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Bernhard and Gurevych, 2009; Cao et al., 2010).

Experiments conducted on real cQA data demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (TRLM and TRLM+CE). There are some ways in which this research could be continued. First, question structure should be considered, so it is necessary to combine the proposed approach with other question retrieval methods (e.g., (Duan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Bunescu and Huang, 2010)) to further improve the performance. Second, we will try to investigate the use of the proposed approach for other kinds of data set, such as categorized questions from forum sites and FAQ sites.

Therefore, we employ an alternative approach − Gibbs sampling (Griffiths, 2002), which is gaining popularity in recent work on latent topic analysis (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Zhou et al., 2008; Wang and McCallum, 2006; Guo et al., 2008; Jo and Oh, 2011). After training the model, we can get the following parameter estimations as: representation of our proposed TMC model is presented in Figure 3. Inspired by the related work on topic analysis (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Zhou et al., 2008; Wang and McCallum, 2006; Guo et al., 2008; Celikyilmaz et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011), we make the following assumptions about the probabilistic structure of TMC model. First, each question is modeled as a multinomial distribution over latent topics, and each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution over words and a multinomial distribution over categories. Second, the prior distributions for topics, words and categories follow different parameterized Dirichlet distribution, which is conjugate prior for multinomial distribution. In Figure 3, for each word w in question q, a topic z is first drawn from the multinomial distribution θq , and then a word is"

(2008) tried to further improve the translation probabilities based on question-answer pairs by selecting the most important terms to build compact translation models. Bernhard and Gurevych (2009) proposed to use as a parallel training data set the definitions and glosses provided for the same term by different lexical semantic resources. Cao et al. (2010) explored adding the category information into the translation model for question retrieval. Zhou et al. (2011) proposed a phrase-based translation model for question retrieval and obtained the stateof-the-art performance. However, all the existing methods ignore the latent topics information in calculating the semantic similarity between questions. In this paper, we present a new approach to discover the latent topic of questions for improving the performance of translation-based language models for question retrieval.

Then depending on whether a word is a seed or non-seed word, a different route of multinomial distribution will be taken to emit the word.

When checking the topics produced by PLDA we can see that it fails to correctly characterise violen and no-violent topics, since PLDA T2 should have been clearly classified as non-violent and the non-violent PLDA T1 as violent. Moreover in the violent PLDA T1 topic which presents violent related words, we can empirically identify more than one event involved. In order to measure the semantic topical coherence of VDM and the proposed baselines, we made use of the Pointwise Mutual Information(PMI) metric proposed in (Newman et al., 2010). PMI is an automatic topic coherence evaluation which has been found to correspond well with human judgements on topic coherence. In particular, a coherent topic should only contain semantically related words and hence any pair of the top words from the same topic should have a large PMI value. For each topic, we compute its PMI by averaging over the PMI of all the word pairs extracted from the top 10 topic words. Figure 3 shows the PMI values of topics extracted under the violence and non-violence classes with the topic numbers varying between 5 and 30. It can be observed that JST and PLDA g"

Based on this idea, templates with higher frequencies will have higher priority than those with the lower frequencies when extracting attributes. After we run through all the pages of the site, we get a collection of templates and attributes. Then we rank them to obtain site-level knowledge. 2.1.3 Ranker To rank obtained templates and attributes to get site-level knowledge, we use the graph walk based technique (Wang and Cohen, 2007)(Wang and Cohen, 2009). In the graph (Figure 2), attributes in initial attribute list are used as seeds. And these seeds are used to match the attributes in weak semi-block of a document (or a page) to learn templates. Then these templates are used to extract new attributes from the weak semi-block of a document (or a page).

There are three main types of methods. The first type of methods translates ONs by building a statistical translation model. The model can be built on the granularity of word [Stalls et al., 1998], phrase [Min Zhang et al., 2005] or structure [Yufeng Chen et al., 2007]. The second type of methods finds the translation equivalent based on the results of alignment from the source ON to the target ON [Huang et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006]. The ONs are extracted from two corpora. The corpora can be parallel corpora [Moore et al., 2003] or contentaligned corpora [Kumano et al., 2004]. The third type of methods introduces the web resources into ON translation.

For example, as shown in Figure 2, the semantic relation between Graphical Model and Computer Science is embedded in the link structure of the Wikipedia. In recent years, some research has investigated to exploit some specific semantic knowledge, such as the social connection between named entities in the Web (Kalashnikov et al. (2008), Wan et al. (2005) and Lu et al. (2007)), the ontology connection in DBLP (Hassell et al., 2006) and the semantic relations in Wikipedia (Cucerzan (2007), Han and Zhao (2009)). These knowledge-based methods, however, usually are specialized to the knowledge sources they used, so they often have the knowledge coverage problem. Furthermore, these methods can only exploit the semantic knowledge to a limited extent because they cannot take the structural semantic knowledge into consideration.

The HAC produce clusters in a bottomup way as follows: Initially, each name observation is an individual cluster; then we iteratively merge the two clusters with the largest similarity value to form a new cluster until this similarity value is smaller than a preset merging threshold or all the observations reside in one common cluster. The merging threshold can be determined through cross-validation. We employ the single-link method to compute the similarity between two clusters, which has been applied widely in prior research (Bagga and Baldwin (1998); Mann and Yarowsky (2003)). In this section we describe how to leverage the semantic knowledge captured in the structural semantic relatedness measure for named entity disambiguation.

In this paper, the goal of phrase-based translation model is to translate a document4 D into a queried question q. Rather than translating single words in isolation, the phrase-based model translates one sequence of words into another sequence of words, thus incorporating contextual information. For example, ∏ we might learn that the phrase “stuffy nose” can be Score(q, D) = (1−λ)Ptr (w|D)+λPml (w|C) (3) translated from “cold” with relative high probabilw∈q ity, even though neither of the individual"

Directly using the IBM model 1 can be problematic, it is possible for translation model to contain “unnecessary” translations (Lee et 657 al., 2008). In this paper, we adopt a variant of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) to identify and eliminate unimportant words from parallel corpus, assuming that a word in a question or answer is unimportant if it holds a relatively low significance in the parallel corpus. Following (Lee et al., 2008), the ranking algorithm proceeds as follows. First, all the words in a given document are added as vertices in a graph G. Then edges are added between words if the words co-occur in a fixed-sized window. The number of co-occurrences becomes the weight of an edge.

Inspired by the |D| t∈D work of (Sun et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2010), we (4) assume the following generative process: first the where P (w|t) denotes the translation probability document D is broken into K non-empty word sefrom word t to word w. quences t1 , . . . , tK , then each t is translated into a new non-empty word sequence w1 , . . . , wK , and fi2.3 Word-Based Translation Language Model nally these phrases are permutated and concatenated Xue et al.

We see that the relationship between accuracy and the number of Ngram is not monotonic for Google V1. The reason may be that Google V1 does not make detailed preprocessing, containing many mistakes in the corpus. Although Google hits is noisier, it has very much larger coverage of bigrams or trigrams. Some previous studies also found a log-linear relationship between unlabeled data (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009; Bergsma et al., 2010; Pitler et al., 2010).

Experimental evaluation and results are reported in Section 4. Finally, we discuss related work and draw conclusion in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. 2 Dependency Parsing In dependency parsing, we attempt to build headmodifier (or head-dependent) relations between words in a sentence. The discriminative parser we used in this paper is based on the part-factored model and features of the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007). The parsing model can be defined as a conditional distribution p(y|x; w) over each projective parse tree y for a particular sentence x, parameterized by a vector w. The probability of a parse tree is {∑ } 1 p(y|x; w) = exp w · Φ(x, ρ) (1) Z(x; w) ρ∈y where Z(x; w) is the partition function and Φ are part-factored feature functions that include headmodifier parts, sibling parts and grandchild parts.

These longer dependencies are therefore a major opportunity to improve the overall performance of dependency parsing. Usually, these longer dependencies can be parsed dependent on the specific words involved due to the limited range of features (e.g., a verb and its modifiers). Lexical statistics are therefore needed for resolving ambiguous relationships, yet the lexicalized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate directly. To solve this problem, some information with different granularity has been investigated. Koo et al. (2008) proposed a semi-supervised dependency parsing by introducing lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method. This approach, however, ignores the selectional preference for word-to-word interactions, such as head-modifier relationship.

Similar observations have been made by Pitler et al. (2010). We see that the relationship between accuracy and the number of Ngram is not monotonic for Google V1. The reason may be that Google V1 does not make detailed preprocessing, containing many mistakes in the corpus. Although Google hits is noisier, it has very much larger coverage of bigrams or trigrams. Some previous studies also found a log-linear relationship between unlabeled data (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009; Bergsma et al., 2010; Pitler et al., 2010).

Similar to (Liu et al., 2012), every sentence in reviews is replicated to generate a parallel sentence pair, and the word alignment algorithm is applied to the monolingual scenario to align a noun/noun phase with its modifiers. We select IBM-3 model (Brown et al., 1993) as the alignment model. Formally, given a sentence S = {w1 , w2 , ..., wn }, we have Pibm3 (A|S) ∝ N Y i=1 n(φi |wi ) N Y j=1 t(wj |waj )d(j|aj , N ) (1) where t(wj |waj ) models the co-occurrence information of two words in dataset. d(j|aj , n) models word position information, which describes the probability of a word in position aj aligned with a word in position j. And n(φi |wi ) describes the ability of a word for modifying (being modified by) several words. φi denotes the number of words 1757 that are aligned with wi . In our experiments, we set φi = 2.

Then we run the whole framework on the corpus with different size (from #500 to #1, 000, 000), domain (three domains) and language (Chinese and English) to empirically assess the performance variations and discuss which method is more effective. Furthermore, this paper naturally addresses another question: is it useful for opinion targets extraction when we combine syntactic patterns and word alignment model into a unified model? To this end, we employ a partially supervised alignment model (PSWAM) like (Gao et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). Based on the exquisitely designed high-precision syntactic patterns, we can obtain some precisely modified relations between words in sentences, which provide a portion of links of the full alignments. Then, these partial alignment links can be regarded as the constrains for a standard unsupervised word alignment model. And each target candidate would find its modifier under the partial supervision. In this way, the errors generated in standard unsupervised WAM can be corrected.

In this paper, we assume opinion targets to be nouns or noun phrases, and opinion words may be adjectives or verbs, which are usually adopted by (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). And a potential opinion relation is comprised of an opinion target candidate and its corresponding modified word. 2) The second component is to estimate the confidence of each candidate. The candidates with higher confidence scores than a threshold will be extracted as opinion targets. In this procedure, we formulate the associations between opinion target candidates and potential opinion words in a bipartite graph. A random walk based algorithm is employed on this graph to estimate the confidence of each target candidate. In this paper, we fix the method in the second com"

To access this problem, we also make comparison between PSWAM based method and the aforementioned methods in the same corpora with different size, language and domain. The experimental results show the combination by using PSWAM can be effective on dataset with small and medium size. 1755 2 Related Work Opinion target extraction isn’t a new task for opinion mining.

Totally, previous studies can be divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised methods. In supervised approaches, the opinion target extraction task was usually regarded as a sequence labeling problem (Jin and Huang, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Ma and Wan, 2010; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009).

However, the sentences in online reviews usually have informal writing styles including grammar mistakes, typos, improper punctuation etc., which make parsing prone to generate mistakes. As a result, the syntax-based methods which heavily depended on the parsing performance would suffer from parsing errors (Zhang et al., 2010). To improve the extraction performance, we can only employ some exquisite highprecision patterns. But this strategy is likely to miss many opinion targets and has lower recall with the increase of corpus size. To resolve these problems, Liu et al.

To fulfill this aim, previous methods exploited the words co-occurrence information to indicate them (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Hu and Liu, 2004b). Obviously, these methods cannot obtain precise extraction because of the diverse expressions by reviewers, like long-span modified relations between words, etc. To handle this problem, several methods exploited syntactic information, where several heuristic patterns based on syntactic parsing were designed (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).

The underlying motivation is analogous to the novel idea “Mine the Easy, Classify the Hard” (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009). In our first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm to cope with the false opinion relation problem, which mines easy cases of opinion words/targets. We speculate that it may be helpful to introduce a confidence score for each pattern. Concretely, we create a Sentiment Graph to model opinion relations among opinion word/target/pattern candidates and apply random walking to estimate confidence of them. Thus, confidence of pattern is considered in a unified process. Patterns that often extract false opinion relations will have low confidence, and terms introduced by low-confiden"

Patterns that often extract false opinion relations will have low confidence, and terms introduced by low-confidence patterns will also have low confidence accordingly. This could potentially improve the extraction accuracy. In the second stage, we identify the hard cases, which aims to filter out false opinion targets and extract long-tail opinion targets. Previous supervised methods have been shown to achieve stateof-the-art results for this task (Wu et al., 2009; Jin and Ho, 2009; Li et al., 2010). However, the big challenge for fully supervised method is the lack of annotated training data. Therefore, we adopt a self-learning strategy. Specifically, we employ a semi-supervised classifier to refine the target results from the first stage, which uses some highly confident target candidates as the initial labeled examples. Then opinion words are also refined.

However, the task of (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) was to classify sentiment orientations in sentence level, while ours needs to extract more detailed information in term level. In addition, our method extends (Xu et al., 2013), and we give a more complete and in-depth analysis on the aforementioned problems in the first section. There were also many works employed graphbased method (Li et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010; Hassan and Radev, 2010; Liu et al., 2012), but none of previous works considered confidence of patterns in the graph. In supervised approaches, various kinds of models were applied, such as HMM (Jin and Ho, 2009), SVM (Wu et al., 2009) and CRFs (Li et al., 2010). The downside of supervised methods was the difficulty of obtaining annotated training data in practical applications. Also, classifiers trained 1765 on one domain often fail to give satisfactory results when shifted to another domain.

We call such relations that match opinion patterns but express no opinion false opinion relations. Previous pattern learning algorithms (Zhuang et al., 2006; Kessler and Nicolov, 2009; Jijkoun et al., 2010) often extract opinion patterns by frequency. However, some high-frequency syntactic patterns can have very poor precision (Kessler and Nicolov, 2009). False Opinion Targets: In another case, the phrase “wonderful time” can be matched by an opinion pattern “Adj-{mod}-Noun”, which is widely used in previous works (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009). As can be seen, this phrase does express a positive opinion but unfortunately “time” is not a valid opinion target for most domains such as MP3. Thus, false opinion targets are extracted. Due to the lack of ground-truth knowledge for opinion targets, non-target terms introduced in this way can be hardly filtered out. Long-tail Opinion Targets: We further notice that previous works prone to extract opinion targets with high frequency (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009), and they often have difficulty in identifying the infrequen"

Popescu and Etzioni (2005) used manually complied syntactic patterns and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to extract opinion words/targets. Qiu et al. (2009) proposed a bootstrapping framework called Double Propagation which introduced eight heuristic syntactic rules. While manually defining syntactic patterns could be timeconsuming and error-prone, we learn syntactic patterns automatically from data. There have been extensive works on mining opinion words and opinion targets by syntactic pattern learning. Riloff and Wiebe (2003) performed pattern learning through bootstrapping while extracting subjective expressions. Zhuang et al. (2006) obtained various dependency relationship templates from an annotated movie corpus and applied them to supervised opinion words/targets extraction. Kobayashi et al. (2007) adopted a supervised learning technique to search for useful syntactic patterns as contextual clues. Our approach is similar to (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) and (Xu et al., 2013), all of which apply syntactic pattern learning and adopt self-learning strategy. However, the task of (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) was to classify"
P13-1173,D09-1159,0,0.157668,"arget/pattern candidates and apply random walking to estimate confidence of them. Thus, confidence of pattern is considered in a unified process. Patterns that often extract false opinion relations will have low confidence, and terms introduced by low-confidence patterns will also have low confidence accordingly. This could potentially improve the extraction accuracy. In the second stage, we identify the hard cases, which aims to filter out false opinion targets and extract long-tail opinion targets. Previous supervised methods have been shown to achieve stateof-the-art results for this task (Wu et al., 2009; Jin and Ho, 2009; Li et al., 2010). However, the big challenge for fully supervised method is the lack of annotated training data. Therefore, we adopt a self-learning strategy. Specifically, we employ a semi-supervised classifier to refine the target results from the first stage, which uses some highly confident target candidates as the initial labeled examples. Then opinion words are also refined. Our main contributions are as follows: • We propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm to mine opinion words and opinion targets from reviews, which naturally incorporates confidence of syntactic"

In our joint model, we extend the baseline features of (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007) by conjoining with the consensus-based features, so that we can learn in which kind of contexts the different parsers agree/disagree.

For example, given two parsers d1 and d2 with candidates H1 and H2 , improvements on H1 enable d2 to improve H2 , and H1 benefits from improved H2 , and so on. We can see that a joint parser does not enlarge the search space of its baseline model, the only change is parse scoring.

We use two baseline parsers, one trained on CTB4, and another trained on CDT in the experiments. We choose the n-best size of 16 and the best iteration time of four on the development set since these settings empirically give the best performance. CTB4 and CDT use two different POS tag sets and transforming from one tag set to another is difficult (Niu et al., 2009). To overcome this problem, we use Stanford POS Tagger1 to train a universal POS tagger on the People’s Daily corpus,2 a large-scale Chinese corpus (approximately 300 thousand sentences and 7 million words) annotated with word segmentation and POS tags. Then the POS tagger produces a universal layer of POS tags for both the CTB4 and CDT.

There are some ways in which this research could be continued. First, recall that the joint inference scheme involves an iterative algorithm by using bootstrapping. Intuitively, there is a lack of formal guarantee. A natural avenue for further research would be the use of more powerful algorithms that provide certificates of optimality; e.g., dual decomposition that aims to develop decoding algorithms with formal guarantees (Rush et al., 2010). Second, we would like to combine our heterogeneous treebank annotations into a unified representation in order to make dependency parsing results comparable across different annotation guidelines (e.g., Tsarfaty et al. (2011)). Table 3: Comparison of different approaches on CTB5 test set. Abbreviations D, C, H and S are as in Table 2.

Here, heterogeneous treebanks refer to two Chinese treebanks: CTB and CDT, therefore we have only two parsers, but the framework is generic enough to integrate more parsers. For easy explanation of the joint inference scheme, we regard a parser without consensus information as a baseline parser, a parser incorporates consensus information called a joint parser. Joint inference provides a framework that accommodates and coordinates multiple dependency parsing models. Similar to Li et al. (2009) and Zhu et al. (2010), the joint inference for heterogeneous dependency parsing consists of four components: (1) Joint Inference Model; (2) Parser Coordination; (3) Joint Inference Features; (4) Parameter Estimation.

To our best knowlIntroduction In opinion mining, extracting opinion targets and opinion words are two fundamental subtasks. Opinion targets are objects about which users’ opinions are expressed, and opinion words are words which indicate opinions’ polarities. Extracting them can provide essential information for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers’ opinions. Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). 314 Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 314–324, c Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 23-25 2014. 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics edge, these problems have seldom been studied before (see Section 2). 2) Ignoring word preference.

Previous methods mainly focused on employing opinion relations among words for opinion target/word co-extraction. They have investigated a series of techniques to enhance opinion relations identification performance, such as nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc. However, we are curious that whether merely employing opinion relations among words is enough for opinion target/word extraction? We note that there are additional types of relations among words. For example, “LCD” and “LED” both denote the same aspect “screen” in TV set domain, and they are topical related. We call such relations between homogeneous words as semantic relations. If we have known “LCD” to be an opinion target, “LED” is naturally to be an opinion target.

However, all aforementioned methods only employed opinion relations for the extraction, but ignore considering semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. Moreover, they all ignored word preference in the extraction process. 3 The Proposed Method In this section, we propose our method in detail. We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as a co-ranking task. All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates, and all adjectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candidates, which are widely adopted by pervious methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Then each candidate will be assigned a confidence and ranked, and the candidates with higher confidence than a threshold will be extracted as the results. Different from traditional methods, besides opinion relations among words, we additionally capture semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. To this end, a heterogeneous undirected graph G = (V, E) is constructed. V = V t ∪ V o denotes the vertex set, which includes opinion target candidates v t ∈ V t and opinion word candidates v o ∈ V o .

Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them.

The main goals of these methods weren’t to extract opinion targets/words, but to categorize all given aspect terms and sentiment words. Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance. Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehri"

In feature-based methods, a diverse set of strategies has been exploited to convert classification clues (such as sequences and parse trees) into feature vectors. Ahn (2006) uses the lexical features(e.g., full word, pos tag), syntactic features (e.g., dependency features) and externalknowledge features(WordNet) to extract the event. Inspired by the hypothesis of “One Sense Per Dis174 course”(Yarowsky, 1995), Ji and Grishman (2008) combined global evidence from related documents with local decisions for the event extraction. To capture more clues from the texts, Gupta and Ji (2009), Liao and Grishman (2010) and Hong et al. (2011) proposed the cross-event and cross-entity inference for the ACE event task. Although these approaches achieve high performance, featurebased methods suffer from the problem of selecting a suitable feature set when converting the classification clues into feature vectors. In structure-based methods, researchers treat event extraction as the task of predicting the structure of the event in a sentence. McClosky et al.

However, in S2, beats is a trigger of type Attack, which is more common than type Elect. Because of the ambiguity, a traditional approach may mislabel beats in S1 as a trigger of Attack. However, if we have the priori knowledge that Obama and McCain are presidential contenders, we have ample evidence to predict that beats is a trigger of type Elect. We call these knowledge lexical-level clues. To represent such features, the existing methods (Hong et al., 2011) often rely on human ingenuity, which is a time-consuming process and lacks generalization.

The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. 1 Introduction Event extraction is an important and challenging task in Information Extraction (IE), which aims to discover event triggers with specific types and their arguments. Current state-of-the-art methods (Li et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Hong et al., 2011; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Ji and Grishman, 2008) often use a set of elaborately designed features that are extracted by textual analysis and linguistic 167 Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 167–176, c Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics In Baghdad , a cameraman died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel. det nsubj amod det prep_in advmod nsubj nn det prep_on advcl Figure 1: Event mentions and syntactic parser results of S3.

However, if we have the priori knowledge that Obama and McCain are presidential contenders, we have ample evidence to predict that beats is a trigger of type Elect. We call these knowledge lexical-level clues. To represent such features, the existing methods (Hong et al., 2011) often rely on human ingenuity, which is a time-consuming process and lacks generalization. Furthermore, traditional lexical features in previous methods are a one-hot representation, which may suffer from the data sparsity problem and may not be able to adequately capture the semantics of the words (Turian et al., 2010). To identify events and arguments more precisely, previous methods often captured contextual features, such as syntactic features, which aim to understand how facts are tied together from a larger field of view. For example, in S3, there are two events that share three arguments as shown in Figure 1. From the dependency relation of nsubj between the argument cameraman and trigger died, we can induce a Victim role to cameraman in the Die event. We call such information sentence-level clues. However, the argument word cameraman and its trigger word fired are in different clauses, and there is n"

We further divide supervised approaches into feature-based methods and structure-based methods. In feature-based methods, a diverse set of strategies has been exploited to convert classification clues (such as sequences and parse trees) into feature vectors. Ahn (2006) uses the lexical features(e.g., full word, pos tag), syntactic features (e.g., dependency features) and externalknowledge features(WordNet) to extract the event. Inspired by the hypothesis of “One Sense Per Dis174 course”(Yarowsky, 1995), Ji and Grishman (2008) combined global evidence from related documents with local decisions for the event extraction. To capture more clues from the texts, Gupta and Ji (2009), Liao and Grishman (2010) and Hong et al. (2011) proposed the cross-event and cross-entity inference for the ACE event task. Although these approaches achieve high performance, featurebased methods suffer from the problem of selecting a suitable feature set when converting the classification clues into feature vectors. In structure-based methods, researchers treat event extraction as the task of predicting the structur"

S3: In Baghdad, a cameraman died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel. To correctly attach cameraman to fired as a Target argument, we must exploit internal semantics over the entire sentence such that the Attack event results in Die event. Recent improvements of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to be efficient for capturing syntactic and semantics between words within a sentence (Collobert et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Zeng et al., 2014) for NLP tasks. CNNs typically use a max-pooling layer, which applies a max operation over the representation of an entire sentence to capture the most useful information. However, in event extraction, one sentence may contain two or more events, and these events may share the argument with different roles. For example, there are two events in S3, namely, the Die event and Attack event. If we use a traditional max-pooling layer and only keep the most important information to represent the sentence, we may obtain the information that depicts “a cameraman died” but miss the information about “Am"

We regularize our model based on these priors to constrain the aspect modeling and improve its accuracy. Figure 3 provides an example of how such priors can be applied to a sentence, with φi representing the prior knowledge. Research has found that most aspect words are nouns (or noun phrases), and sentiment is often expressed with adjectives. This additional information has been utilized in previous work on aspect extraction (Hu and Liu, 2004; Benamara et al., 2007; Pang et al., 2002). Inspired by this, we first rely on Part of Speech (POS) Tagging to identify nouns and adjectives.

Additionally, rule-based methods have a common shortcoming in failing to group extracted aspect terms into categories.

These supervised approaches for aspect identification are generally based on standard sequence labeling techniques.

Regarding aspect identification, previous methods can be divided into three main categories: rule-based, supervised, and topic model-based methods. For instance, association rule-based methods (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 1998) tend to focus on extracting product feature words and opinion words but neglect connecting product features at the aspect level. Existing rule-based methods typically are not able to group the extracted aspect terms into categories. Supervised (Jin et al., 2009; Choi and Cardie, 2010) and semisupervised learning methods (Zagibalov and Carroll, 2008; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) were introduced to resolve certain aspect identification problems. However, supervised training requires handlabeled training data and has trouble coping with domain adaptation scenarios. Hence, unsupervised methods are often adopted to avoid this sort of dependency on labeled data.

Given a question, the goal is to choose the answer from a set of pre-selected sentences (Heilman and Smith, 2010; Yao et al., 2013). Traditional AS models are based on lexical features such as parsing tree edit distance. Neural networks based models are proposed to represent the meaning of a sentence in a vector space and then compare the question and answer candidates in this hidden space (Wang and Nyberg, 2015; Feng et al., 2015), which have shown great success in AS. However, these models represent the question and sentence separately, which may ignore the information subject to the question when representing the answer.

Wang and Manning (2007) try to compare the question and answer sentence by their syntactical matching in parse trees.

Finally, we improve the performance of event detection and achieve a new state-of-the-art result by using the events automatically detected from FN. 1 Introduction In the ACE (Automatic Context Extraction) event extraction program, an event is represented as a structure consisting of an event trigger and a set of arguments. This paper tackles with the event detection (ED) task, which is a crucial component in the overall task of event extraction. The goal of ED is to identify event triggers and their corresponding event types from the given documents. FrameNet (FN) (Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2003) is a linguistic resource storing considerable information about lexical and predicateargument semantics. In FN, a frame is defined as a composition of a Lexical Unit (LU) and a set of Frame Elements (FE). Most frames contain a set of exemplars with annotated LUs and FEs (see Figure 2 and Section 2.2 for details). From the above definitions of events and frames, it is not hard to find that the frames defined in FN share highly similar structures as the events defined in ACE. Firstly, the LU of a Frame plays a similar role as the trigger of an event. ACE defines the trig"

Given a sentence, we concatenate the embedding vector of the candidate trigger and the average embedding vector of the words in the sentence as the input to our model.

However, a fixed vector is not enough to obtain a better result on generating a long targets.The attention mechanism in the decoding can dynamically choose context ct at each time step (Bahdanau et al., 2014), for example, representing ct as the weighted sum of the source states {ht }, ct = XLX eρ(st−1 ,hi ) αti hi ; αti = P ρ(s ,h0 ) t−1 i i=1 i0 e The Copying Mechanism 3 COREQA To generate natural answers for information inquired questions, we should first recognize k"

Although existing end-to-end models for KB-based question answering, such as GenQA (Yin et al., 2016), were able to retrieve facts from KBs with neural models. Unfortunately, they cannot copy SUs from the question in generating answers. Moreover, they could not deal with complex questions which need to utilize multiple facts. In addition, existing approaches for conversational (Dialogue) systems are able to generate natural utterances (Serban et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) in sequence-tosequence learning (Seq2Seq). But they cannot interact with KB and answer information-inquired questions. For example, CopyNet (Gu et al., 2016) is able to copy words from the original source in generating the target through incorporating copying mechanism in conventional Seq2Seq learning, but they cannot retrieve SUs from external memory (e.g. KBs, Texts, etc.). • We propose a neural network based model, named as COREQA, by incorporating copying and retrieving mechanism in Seq2Seq learning.

To avoid this, we employ bidirectional LSTM as Bahdanau (2015) does, which consists of both forward and backward networks. The forward LSTM handles the question from left to right, and the backward LSTM processes in the reverse order.

We could employ behavioral information of existing similar reviewers to a new reviewer to approximate his behavioral features. We argue that a reviewer’s individual characteristics such as background information, motivation, and interactive behavior style have a great influence on a reviewer’s textual and behavioral information.

Because the number of nouns in one sentence is usually larger than that of verbs, it is hard to use TR to find nominal triggers. Thus, we propose to use linguistic resource FrameNet to filter noisy verbal triggers and expand nominal triggers. As the success of word embedding in capturing semantics of words (Turian et al., 2010), we employ word embedding to map the events in Freebase to frames in FrameNet. Specifically, we use the average word embedding of all words in i-th Freebase event type name ei and word embedding of k-th lexical units of j-th frame ej,k to compute the semantic similarity. Finally, we select the frame contains max similarity of ei and ej,k as the mapped frame, which can be formulated as follows: f rame(i) = arg max(similarity(ei , ej,k )) (7) j Then, we filter the verb, which is in initial verbal trigger word lexicon and not in the mapping frame.

The first kind of approach tackled this task under the supervision of annotated triggers and entities, but totally ignored annotated arguments.

Feature-based methods exploited a diverse set of strategies to convert classification clues (i.e., POS tags, dependency relations) into feature vectors (Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009; Gupta and Ji, 2009; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Hong et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016b). Representation-based methods typically represent candidate event mentions by embeddings and feed them into neural networks (Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Liu et al., 2016a; Nguyen and Grishman, 2016).

For candidates without any annotated arguments in context (such as negative samples), we force all entities to average the whole attention. Figure 2 illustrates the details, where α∗ is the final gold attention vector. to ED, the words around them are also helpful. And the nearer a word is to arguments, the more attention it should obtain. Inspired by Mi et al. (2016), we use a gaussian distribution g(·) to model the attention distribution of words around arguments. In detail, given an instance, we first obtain the raw attention vector α in the same manner as S1 (see figure 2). ′ Then, we create a new vector α with all points initialized with zero, and for each αi = 1, we ′ update α by the following algorithm: Algorithm 1: Updating α ′ for k ∈ {−w, ..., 0, ..., w} do ′ ′ αi+k = αi+k + g(|k|, µ, σ) end where w is the window size of the attention mechanism and µ, σ are hyper-parameters of the gaussian distribution.

Table 3 presents the experimental results on ACE 2005 corpus. From the table, we make the following observations: 1). ANN performs unexpectedly poorly, which indicates that unsupervised-attention mechanisms do not work well for ED. We believe the reason is that the training data of ACE 2005 corpus is insufficient to train a precise attention in an unsupervised manner, considering that data sparseness is an important issue of ED (Zhu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016a). 2). With argument information employed via supervised attention mechanisms, both ANN-S1 and ANN-S2 outperform ANN with remarkable gains, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 3).

The first kind of approach tackled this task under the supervision of annotated triggers and entities, but totally ignored annotated arguments. The majority of existing work followed this paradigm, which includes feature-based methods and representationbased methods. Feature-based methods exploited a diverse set of strategies to convert classification clues (i.e., POS tags, dependency relations) into feature vectors (Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009; Gupta and Ji, 2009; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Hong et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016b). Representation-based methods typically represent candidate event mentions by embeddings and feed them into neural networks (Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Liu et al., 2016a; Nguyen and Grishman, 2016). The second kind of approach, on the contrast, tackled event detection and argument extraction simultaneously, which is called joint approach (Riedel et al., 2009; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Li et al., 2013, 2014; Venugopal et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2016).

Theoretically, both ED and AE are expected to benefit from joint methods because triggers and arguments are jointly considered. However, in practice, existing joint methods usually only make remarkable improvements to AE, but insignificant to ED. Different from them, this work investigates the exploitation of argument information to improve the performance of ED."

Extracting event instances from texts plays a critical role in building NLP applications such as Information Extraction (IE), Question Answer (QA) and Summarization (Ahn, 2006). Recently, researchers have built some English EE systems, such as EventRegistry7 and Stela8 . However, in financial domain, there is no such effective EE system, especially in Chinese. Financial events are able to help users obtain competitors’ strategies, predict the stock market and make correct investment decisions. For example, the occurrence of an Equity Freeze event will have a bad effect on the company and the shareholders should make correct decisions quickly to avoid the losses.

The distinguishing difference of semantic parsing, however, is in its target sequences, which are token sequences of well-formed semantic representations. SQL language and lambda expressions are typical examples of SP targets. The “SELECT..FROM..WHERE” pattern in SQL and the paired parentheses in lambda expressions are consequences of underlying grammars. However, standard Seq2Seq models ignore the patterns and may give ill-formed results. To better model the grammatical and semantical constraints, many decoding methods were devised. Dong and Lapata (2018) proposed to generate tokens of an intermediate sketch first, followed by decoding into final formal targets. Others chose to gradually build abstract syntax trees using a transition-based paradigm, and tokens are generated at the tree leaves or in the middle of the transitions (Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Yin and Neubig, 2018).

In this way, it is unnecessary to pre-build any intermediate supervision for training, such as preprocessed sketches (Dong and Lapata, 2018) and predesigned grammars (Yin and Neubig, 2018), which must be manually redesigned for an unseen kind of target language. Furthermore, we use the model uncertainty estimates to reflect its prediction confidence. Although different uncertainty estimates have been explored in semantic parsing (Dong et al., 2018), we use Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) as the uncertainty signal (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) due 4265 Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4265–4270 c Florence, Italy, July 28 - August 2, 2019. 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics Pondering Mode to its simplicity, and use policy gradient algorithm to guide the model search.

Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art neural models and does not need any expertise like predefined grammar or sketches in the meantime. 1 Introduction Semantic Parsing (SP) maps a natural language utterance into a formal language, which is crucial in abundant tasks, such as question answering (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007) and code generation (Yin and Neubig, 2017). The prevailing neural semantic parsers view semantic parsing as a sequence transduction task, and adopt the encoder-decoder framework similar to machine translation. The distinguishing difference of semantic parsing, however, is in its target sequences, which are token sequences of well-formed semantic representations. SQL language and lambda expressions are typical examples of SP targets. The “SELECT..FROM..WHERE” pattern in SQL and the paired parentheses in lambda expressions are consequences of underlying grammars.

The experiments show that the proposed model is more suitable for Chinese baseNP analysis and the proposed MDLbased algorithm is superior to the traditional MLbased algorithm. The paper also discusses the problem of incorporating the linguistic knowledge into the above statistical model. 1. Introduction The concept of baseNP is initially put forward by Church. In English, baseNP is defined as 'simple non-recursive noun phrases', which means that there is no sub-noun-phrases contained in a baseNP[1]. B~t the definition can not meet the needs in Chinese information retrieval. The noun phrases such as &quot;1~ ~(natural) ~-~(language) ~ ( p r o c e s s ) &quot; , &quot;~-IF~b~l(Asian) ~;-'~!]~(finance) ~f~ ~(crisis)&quot; and &quot; i ~ ( p o l i t i c a l ) /¢~k$1J(system) ~(reformation) ~.~(process)&quot; are critical for information retrieval, but they are not nonrecursive noun phrases. In Chinese, the attribute of noun phrases can be classified into three types, that is restrictive attributes, distinctive attributes and descriptive attributes, among which the restrictive attributes have agglutinative relation with"

There are the following 3 kinds of quasidependency-pattern for a tri-word-composed baseNP xyz. 2. The quasi-dependency model There are two kinds of structural analysis models for Eng!ish noun phrase, that is adjacency model and dependency model. The research of Lauer shows that the dependency model is superior to the adjacency model for structural analysis of English noun phrase[2]. However, there is no model for structural analysis of Chinese baseNP till now. According to the dependency grammar, two constituents can be bound together they are determined to be dependent.

For example, a bracketed Chinese sentence, [ 外商(foreign businessmen) 投资(investment)] 成 为 (become) [ 中 国 (Chinese) 外 贸 (foreign trade)] [ 重要(important) 增长点(growth)] 。 The IOB tags are used to indicate the boundaries for each base NP where letter ‘B’ means the current word starts a base NP, ‘I’ for a word inside a base NP and ‘O’ for a word outside a NP chunk. In this case the tokens for the former sentence would be labeled as follows: 外商/B 投资/I 成为/V 中国/B 外贸/I 重要/B 增长点/O 。/O Currently, most of the work"

The eleven systems for the CoNLL-2000 shared task used a wide variety of machine learning methods. The best system in this workshop is on the basis of Support Vector Machines used by (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).
