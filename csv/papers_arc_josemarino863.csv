All systems presented are based on standard phrase-based Moses systems. Variations adopted several improvement techniques such as morphology simplification and generation and domain adaptation. The morphology simplification overcomes the data sparsity problem when translating into morphologically-rich languages such as Spanish by translating first to a morphology-simplified language and secondly leave the morphology generation to an independent classification task. The domain adaptation approach improves the SMT system by adding new translation units learned from MT-output and reference alignment. Results depict an improvement on TER, METEOR, NIST and BLEU scores compared to our baseline system, obtaining on the official test set more benefits from the domain adaptation approach than from the morphological generalization method."

The paper studies whether the morphological richness of the target language causes poor quality translation when translating out-of-domain. In detail, this approach first translates into Spanish simplified forms and then predicts the final inflected forms through a morphology generation step based on shallow and deep-projected linguistic information available from both the source and target-language sentences. Obtained results highlight the importance of generalization, and therefore generation, for dealing with out-of-domain data."

Since both paradigms have largely been used during the last years, one of the aims in the research community is to know how these systems differ in terms of translation quality. To this end, this paper reports a study and comparison of a rule-based and a corpus-based (particularly, statistical) Catalan-Spanish machine translation systems, both of them freely available in the web. The translation quality analysis is performed under two different domains: journalistic and medical. The systems are evaluated by using standard automatic measures, as well as by native human evaluators. Automatic results show that the statistical system performs better than the rule-based system. Human judgements show that in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction the statistical system also performs better than the rule-based system, while in the Catalan-to-Spanish direction is the other way round. Although the statistical system obtains the best automatic scores, its errors tend to be more penalized by human judgements than the errors of the rule-based system. This can be explained because statistical errors are usually unexpected and they do not follow any pattern."

The SMT system is a standard phrase-based enriched with novel segmentations. These novel segmentations are computed using statistical measures such as Log-likelihood, T-score, Chi-squared, Dice, Mutual Information or Gravity-Counts. The analysis of translation results allows to divide measures into three groups. First, Log-likelihood, Chi-squared and T-score tend to combine high frequency words and collocation segments are very short. They improve the SMT system by adding new translation units. Second, Mutual Information and Dice tend to combine low frequency words and collocation segments are short. They improve the SMT system by smoothing the translation units. And third, GravityCounts tends to combine high and low frequency words and collocation segments are long. However, in this case, the SMT system is not improved. Thus, the road-map for translation system improvement is to introduce new phrases with either low frequency or high frequency words. It is hard to introduce new phrases with low and high frequency words in order to improve translation quality. Experimental results are reported in the French-to-English IWSLT 2010 evaluation where our system was ranked 3rd out of nine systems."

Over the last years, a variety of automatic evaluation measures have been studied, some of them like Word Error Rate (WER), Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER) and BLEU and NIST scores have become widely used tools for comparing different systems as well as for evaluating improvements within one system. However, these measures do not give any details about the nature of translation errors.

On the one hand, we allow for an Ngram-based decoder (MARIE) to perform a reordered search over the source sentence, while combining a translation tuples Ngram model, a target language model, a word penalty and a word distance model. Interestingly, even though the translation units are learnt sequentially, its reordered search produces an improved translation. On the other hand, we allow for a modification of the translation units that unfolds the tuples, so that shorter units are learnt from a new parallel corpus, where the source sentences are reordered according to the target language. This tuple unfolding technique reduces data sparseness and, when combined with the reordered search, further boosts translation performance. Translation accuracy and efficency results are reported for the IWSLT 2004 Chinese to English task."

TALP generates translations by searching for the best scoring path through a Finite-State Transducers (FSTs), which models an Xgram of the bilingual language defined by tuples. A detailed description of the system and the core processes to train it from a parallel corpus are presented. Results on the Chinese-English supplied task of the Int. Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLTxe2x80x9904) Evaluation Campaign are shown and discussed. 1. Overview of the system TALP (Traduccio Automatica del Llenguatge Parlat) is a speech-to-speech statistical machine translation system developed at the TALP Research Center (Barcelona, Spain) during the last years. It implements an integrated architecture by joining speech recognition and translation in one single step. Mathematically, the system produces a translation by maximizing the joint probability between source and target languages, which is equivalent to a language model of an special language with bilingual units (called tuples). TALP implements this tuple language model by means of a Finite-State Transducer (FST) considering an Xgram memory, that is, a variablelength N-gram model which adapts its length to evidence in the data. Xgrams have proved good results in speech recognition tasks in the past [1]. Given such a bilingual FST, the search for a translation becomes the search for the best-scoring path among the transducerxe2x80x99s edges. This search can be performed by dynamic programming, using well-known decoding techniques from the speech recognition domain. This way, the Viterbi algorithm and a beam search can be used forwards taking only source-language words into account (first part of each tuple), reading words in the target language during trace-back to produce the translation. Using This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Government under grant TIC2002-04447-C02 (ALIADO project), the European Union under grant FP6-506738 (TC-STAR project) and the Dep. of Universities, Research and Information Society (Generalitat de Catalunya). Figure 1: A translation FST from Spanish to English the same structure and search method, acoustic models can be omitted to perform text translation tasks only. This translation FST is learned automatically from a parallel corpus in three main steps (and an optional preprocessing). First, an automatic word alignment is produced. Currently this is done by the freely-available GIZA software [2], implementing well-known IBM and HMM translation models [3, 4]. From this alignment, a tuple extraction algorithm generates the set tuples that induces a sequential segmentation of both source and target sentences. These tuples must respect word order in both languages, as this is necessary for the transducer to produce a correct-order translated output. Finally, Xgrams are learned using standard language modeling techniques. Previous publications on this system include [5] and [6]. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 offers an overview of the system architecture, whereas sections 2 and 3 deepen into details on translation generation and training issues. Section 4 presents the experimental framework used to evaluate the system, whose results are discussed in section 5. Finally, section 6 concludes and outlines future research lines. 2. Translation generation Statistical machine translation is based on the assumption that every sentence e in the target language is a possible translation of a given sentence f in the source language. The main difference between two possible translations of a given sentence is a probability assigned to each, which is to be learned from a bilingual text corpus. This probability can be modeled by a joint probability model of source and target languages. In this case, solving the translation problem is finding the sentence in the target language that maximises equation 1. This probability can be approximated by an Xgram of a joint or bilingual language model, learned from a set of tuples, as expressed in equation 2. e = arg max e {p(e, f)} = xc2xb7 xc2xb7 xc2xb7 = (1)"
