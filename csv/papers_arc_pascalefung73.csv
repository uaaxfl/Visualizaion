In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end dialogue system which aims to ease the isolation of people under self-quarantine. We conduct a control simulation experiment to assess the effects of the user interface: a web-based virtual agent, Nora vs. the android ERICA via a video call. The experimental results show that the android can offer a more valuable user experience by giving the impression of being more empathetic and engaging in the conversation due to its nonverbal information, such as facial expressions and body gestures."

However, dealing with politically sensitive content in a responsible, non-partisan, and safe behavior way is integral for these chatbots. Currently, the main approach to handling political sensitivity is by simply changing such a topic when it is detected. This is safe but evasive and results in a chatbot that is less engaging. In this work, as a first step towards a politically safe chatbot, we propose a group of metrics for assessing their political prudence. We then conduct political prudence analysis of various chatbots and discuss their behavior from multiple angles through our automatic metric and human evaluation metrics. The testsets and codebase are released to promote research in this area."

However, the fine-tuning process inevitably changes the parameters of the pre-trained model and weakens its cross-lingual ability, which leads to sub-optimal performance. To alleviate this problem, we leverage continual learning to preserve the original cross-lingual ability of the pre-trained model when we fine-tune it to downstream tasks. The experimental result shows that our fine-tuning methods can better preserve the cross-lingual ability of the pre-trained model in a sentence retrieval task. Our methods also achieve better performance than other fine-tuning baselines on the zero-shot cross-lingual part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition tasks."

Unlike previous models that learn to generate the hierarchical representations for nested intents and slots, we propose to predict intents and slots separately and cast both prediction tasks into sequence labeling problems. After that, we further propose a fertility-based slot predictor that first learns to detect the number of labels for each token, and then predicts the slot types. Experimental results illustrate that our model can significantly outperform existing strong baselines in cross-lingual and cross-domain settings, and our model can also achieve a good generalization ability on target languages of target domains. Furthermore, we show that our model can reduce the latency by up to 66{\%} compared to the generation-based model."

Our dataset includes persona conversations in six different languages other than English for evaluating multilingual personalized agents. We experiment with both multilingual and cross-lingual trained baselines and evaluate them against monolingual and translation-pipeline models using both automatic and human evaluation. Experimental results show that the multilingual trained models outperform the translation pipeline and that they are on par with the monolingual models, with the advantage of having a single model across multiple languages. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art cross-lingual trained models achieve inferior performance to the other models, showing that cross-lingual conversation modeling is a challenging task.

Recently, large pre-trained language models have shown great performance in few-shot learning for various downstream tasks, such as question answering and machine translation. Nevertheless, little exploration has been made to achieve few-shot learning for the fact-checking task. However, fact-checking is an important problem, especially when the amount of information online is growing exponentially every day. In this paper, we propose a new way of utilizing the powerful transfer learning ability of a language model via a perplexity score. The most notable strength of our methodology lies in its capability in few-shot learning. With only two training samples, our methodology can already outperform the Major Class baseline by more than an absolute 10{\%} on the F1-Macro metric across multiple datasets. Through experiments, we empirically verify the plausibility of the rather surprising usage of the perplexity score in the context of fact-checking and highlight the strength of our few-shot methodology by comparing it to strong fine-tuning-based baseline models.

However, the extracted features are fixed and cannot be further fine-tuned on different target tasks, and manually finding feature extracting algorithms does not generalize or scale well to different tasks, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we develop a fully end-to-end model that connects the two phases and optimizes them jointly. In addition, we restructure the current datasets to enable the fully end-to-end training. Furthermore, to reduce the computational overhead brought by the end-to-end model, we introduce a sparse cross-modal attention mechanism for the feature extraction. Experimental results show that our fully end-to-end model significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art models based on the two-phase pipeline.

Specifically, we investigate the second phase of pre-training on large-scale generative models under three different settings: 1) source domain pre-training; 2) domain-adaptive pre-training; and 3) task-adaptive pre-training. Experiments show that the effectiveness of pre-training is correlated with the similarity between the pre-training data and the target domain task. Moreover, we find that continuing pre-training could lead to the pre-trained model{'}s catastrophic forgetting, and a learning method with less forgetting can alleviate this issue. Furthermore, results illustrate that a huge gap still exists between the low-resource and high-resource settings, which highlights the need for more advanced domain adaptation methods for the abstractive summarization task."

However, such data are not always available. Hence, cross-domain slot filling has naturally arisen to cope with this data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-fine approach (Coach) for cross-domain slot filling. Our model first learns the general pattern of slot entities by detecting whether the tokens are slot entities or not. It then predicts the specific types for the slot entities. In addition, we propose a template regularization approach to improve the adaptation robustness by regularizing the representation of utterances based on utterance templates. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in slot filling. Furthermore, our model can also be applied to the cross-domain named entity recognition task, and it achieves better adaptation performance than other existing baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/zliucr/coach."

Our model learns to recognize individual languages, and transfer them so as to better recognize mixed-language speech by conditioning the optimization on the code-switching data. Based on experimental results, our model outperforms existing baselines on speech recognition and language modeling tasks, and is faster to converge."

In this paper, we propose a modality-transferable model with emotion embeddings to tackle the aforementioned issues. We use pre-trained word embeddings to represent emotion categories for textual data. Then, two mapping functions are learned to transfer these embeddings into visual and acoustic spaces. For each modality, the model calculates the representation distance between the input sequence and target emotions and makes predictions based on the distances. By doing so, our model can directly adapt to the unseen emotions in any modality since we have their pre-trained embeddings and modality mapping functions. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the emotion categories. Besides, our model also outperforms existing baselines in the zero-shot and few-shot scenarios for unseen emotions."

This is achieved by obtaining an (\textit{M}+1)-way tensor to consider the high-order relationships between \textit{M} modalities and the output layer of a neural network model. Applying a modality-based tensor factorization method, which adopts different factors for different modalities, results in removing information present in a modality that can be compensated by other modalities, with respect to model outputs. This helps to understand the relative utility of information in each modality. In addition it leads to a less complicated model with less parameters and therefore could be applied as a regularizer avoiding overfitting. We have applied this method to three different multimodal datasets in sentiment analysis, personality trait recognition, and emotion recognition. We are able to recognize relationships and relative importance of different modalities in these tasks and achieves a 1{\%} to 4{\%} improvement on several evaluation measures compared to the state-of-the-art for all three tasks."

User generated labels for any type of online data can be sparing per individual user but intractably large among all users. It would be useful to automatically select a smaller, standard set of labels to represent the whole label set. We can then solve efficiently the problem of multi-label learning with an intractably large number of interdependent labels, such as automatic tagging of Wikipedia pages. We propose a submodular maximization framework with linear cost to find informative labels which are most relevant to other labels yet least redundant with each other. A simple prediction model can then be trained on this label subset. Our framework includes both label-label and label-feature dependencies, which aims to find the labels with the most representation and prediction ability. In addition, to avoid information loss, we extract and predict outlier labels with weak dependency on other labels. We apply our model to four standard natural language data sets including Bibsonomy entries with users assigned tags, web pages with user assigned tags, legal texts with EUROVOC descriptors(A topic hierarchy with almost 4000 categories regarding different aspects of European law) and Wikipedia pages with tags from social bookmarking as well as news videos for automated label detection from a lexicon of semantic concepts. Experimental results show that our proposed approach improves label prediction quality, in terms of precision and nDCG, by 3{\%} to 5{\%} in three of the 5 tasks and is competitive in the others, even with a simple linear prediction model. An ablation study shows how different data sets benefit from different aspects of our model, with all aspects contributing substantially to at least one data set."

The model learns how to combine words from parallel sentences and identifies when to switch one language to the other. Moreover, it captures code-switching constraints by attending and aligning the words in inputs, without requiring any external knowledge.

Based on this, MoEL will softly combine the output states of the appropriate Listener(s), which are each optimized to react to certain emotions, and generate an empathetic response.

In contrast, the language pairs with the higest F-measure where SPA-EN and NEP-EN. The task made evident that language identification in code-switched data is still far from solved and warrants further research."

The motivation of this paper is to study the rules and constraints code-switching follows and design a corpus for code-switching LVCSR task. This paper presents the development of a Mandarin-English code-switching corpus. This corpus consists of four parts: 1) conversational meeting speech and its data; 2) project meeting speech data; 3) student interviews speech; 4) text data of on-line news. The speech was transcribed by an annotator and verified by Mandarin-English bilingual speakers manually. We propose an approach for automatically downloading from the web text data that contains code-switching. The corpus includes both intra-sentential code-switching (switch in the middle of a sentence) and inter-sentential code-switching (switch at the end of the sentence). The distribution of part-of-speech (POS) tags and code-switching reasons are reported.

We therefore propose syntactic reordering for cross-lingual language modeling, and present a first result that compares inversion transduction grammar (ITG) reordering constraints to IBM and local constraints in an integrated speech transcription and translation system. Evaluations on resource-poor Cantonese speech transcription and Cantonese to resource-rich Mandarin translation tasks show that our proposed approach improves the system performance significantly, up to 3.4% relative WER reduction in Cantonese transcription and 13.3% relative bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score improvement in Mandarin transcription compared with the system without reordering."

Moreover, we show that our system can be trained on a pair of languages and test on a different pair of languages, obtaining a F-Measure of 77% for the classification of Chinese-English translations using a training corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is therefore even potentially applicable to low resources languages without training data."

We therefore propose a method of parsing presentation transcriptions into a rhetorical syntax tree and then re-order the leaf nodes to transform the speech transcriptions into an extractive summary akin to a process of presentation slide generation. Chunking, parsing, and reordering are carried out by 28-class Hidden Markov Support Vector Machine(HMSVM) classifier trained from reference presentations and presentation slides. Using ROUGE-L F-measure we showed that our rhetorical syntaxdriven model gives a 35.8% relative improvement over a binary summarizer with no rhetorical information, a 14.3% improvement over Rhetorical State Hidden Markov Model(RSHMM) (Fung et al., 2008), and a 4.3% improvement over our proposed model with no reordering."

The training process of feature-based summarization model usually requires a large amount of training data with high-quality reference summaries. Human production of such summaries is tedious, and since inter-labeler agreement is low, very unreliable. Active learning helps assuage this problem by automatically selecting a small amount of unlabeled documents for humans to hand correct. Our method chooses the unlabeled documents according to the similarity score between the document and the comparable resource---PowerPoint slides. After manual correction, the selected documents are returned to the training pool. Summarization results show an increasing learning curve of ROUGE-L F-measure, from 0.44 to 0.514, consistently higher than that of using randomly chosen training samples."

In addition, we show that structural features are superior to lexical features and our summarizer performs surprisingly well at the average F-measure of 0.3914 by using only acoustic features. These findings enable us to summarize speech without placing a stringent demand on speech recognition accuracy."

We describe ARG ALIGN, a new model for learning bilingual semantic frames that employs monolingual Chinese and English semantic parsers to learn bilingual semantic role mappings with 72.45% Fscore, given an unannotated parallel corpus. We show that, contrary to a common preconception, our ARG ALIGN model is superior to a semantic role projection model, SYN ALIGN, which reaches only a 46.63% F-score by assuming semantic parallelism in bilingual sentences. We present experimental data explaining that this is due to crosslingual mismatches between argument structures in English and Chinese at 17.24% of the time. This suggests that, in any potential application to enhance machine translation with semantic structural mapping, it may be preferable to employ independent automatic semantic parsers on source and target languages, rather than assuming semantic role parallelism."

We also carried out a pilot study on using this automatically generated bilingual word sense dictionary to choose the best translation candidates and show the first significant evidence that frame semantics are useful for translation disambiguation. Translation disambiguation accuracy using frame semantics is 75%, compared to 15% by using dictionary glossing only.

Our approach leverages a strong language universal constraint posited by the ITG Hypothesis, that can serve as a strong inductive bias for various language learning problems, resulting in both efficiency and accuracy gains. The task we attack is highly practical since non-parallel multilingual data exists in far greater quantities than parallel corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Our aim here is to mine truly parallel sentences, as opposed to comparable sentence pairs or loose translations as in most previous work. The method we introduce exploits Bracketing ITGs to produce the first known results for this problem. Experiments show that it obtains large accuracy gains on this task compared to the expected performance of state-of-the-art models that were developed for the less stringent task of mining comparable sentence pairs."

We propose to induce the mapping between the English lexical entries in FrameNet to Chinese word senses in HowNet, furnishing a bilingual semantic lexicon which simulates the concept lexicon supposedly used by human translators, and which can thus be beneficial to machine translation systems. BiFrameNet also contains bilingual example sentences that have the same semantic roles. We automatically induce Chinese example sentences and their semantic roles, based on semantic structure alignment from the first stage of our work, as well as shallow syntactic structure.

Extractive summarization selects salient sentences from documents to be included in a summary. Unsupervised clustering combined with heuristics is a popular approach because no annotated data is required. However, conventional clustering methods such as K-means do not take text cohesion into consideration. Probabilistic methods are more rigorous and robust, but they usually require supervised training with annotated data. Our method incorporates unsupervised training with clustering, into a probabilistic framework. Clustering is done by modified K-means (MKM)---a method that yields more optimal clusters than the conventional K-means method. Text cohesion is modeled by the transition probabilities of an HMM, and term distribution is modeled by the emission probabilities. The final decoding process tags sentences in a text with theme class labels. Parameter training is carried out by the segmental K-means (SKM) algorithm. The output of our system can be used to extract salient sentences for summaries, or used for topic detection. Content-based evaluation shows that our method outperforms an existing extractive summarizer by 22.8% in terms of relative similarity, and outperforms a baseline summarizer that selects the top N sentences as salient sentences by 46.3%."

W97-0406,Dealing with Multilinguality in a Spoken Language Query Translator,1997,0,1,1,1,1509,pascale fung,Spoken Language Translation,0,In this paper we examine three issues concerning the robustness of multilingual speech interfaces for spoken language translation systems accent di erences mixed language input and the use of common feature sets for HMM based speech recognizers for English and Cantonese From the results of our preliminary experiments we nd that accent di erence causes recognizers performance to degrade For mixed language input we found out that a straight forward implementation of a mixed language model based speech recognizer performs less well than the concatenation of pure language recognizers due to the increase in recognition candidate numbers Finally our experimental results show that the Cantonese recognizer has a lower recognition rate on the average than the English recognizer despite a common feature set parameter set and common algorithm
W97-0119,Finding Terminology Translations from Non-parallel Corpora,1997,17,119,1,1,1509,pascale fung,Fifth Workshop on Very Large Corpora,0,"We present a statistical word feature, the Word Relation Matrix, which can be used to find translated pairs of words and terms from non-parallel corpora, across language groups. Online dictionary entries are used as seed words to generate Word Relation Matrices for the unknown words according to correlation measures. Word Relation Matrices are then mapped across the corpora to find translation pairs. Translation accuracies are around 30% when only the top candidate is counted. Nevertheless, top 20 candidate output give a 50.9% average increase in accuracy on human translator performance."
W95-0114,Compiling Bilingual Lexicon Entries From a Non-Parallel {E}nglish-{C}hinese Corpus,1995,12,141,1,1,1509,pascale fung,Third Workshop on Very Large Corpora,0,"We propose a novel context heterogeneity similarity measure between words and their translations in helping to compile bilingual lexicon entries from a non-parallel English-Chinese corpus. Current algorithms for bilingual lexicon compilation rely on occurrence frequencies, length or positional statistics derived from parallel texts. There is little correlation between such statistics of a word and its translation in non-parallel corpora. On the other hand, we suggest that words with productive context in one language translate to words with productive context in another language, and words with rigid context translate into words With rigid context. Context heterogeneity measures how productive the context of a word is in a given domain, independent of its absolute occurrence frequency in the text. Based on this information, we derive statistics of bilingual word pairs from a non-parallel corpus. These statistics can be used to bootstrap a bilingual dictionary compilation algorithm."
P95-1032,A Pattern Matching Method for Finding Noun and Proper Noun Translations from Noisy Parallel Corpora,1995,15,81,1,1,1509,pascale fung,33rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"We present a pattern matching method for compiling a bilingual lexicon of nouns and proper nouns from unaligned, noisy parallel texts of Asian/Indo-European language pairs. Tagging information of one language is used. Word frequency and position information for high and low frequency words are represented in two different vector forms for pattern matching. New anchor point finding and noise elimination techniques are introduced. We obtained a 73.1% precision. We also show how the results can be used in the compilation of domain-specific noun phrases."

CMMs differ from standard hidden Markov models in that state sequence assignments can take on values coerced from external sources. Given a Chinese sentence, a CMM can be used to predict the corresponding English tag sequence, thus constraining the English lexical sequence produced by a translation model. The CMM can also be used to score competing translation hypotheses in N-best models. Three fundamental problems for CMM designed are discussed. Their solutions lead to the training and testing stages of CMM."

Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product. We present an alternative alignment strategy which we call K-vec, that starts by estimating the lexicon. For example, it discovers that the English word fisheries is similar to the French peches by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of p&ecirc'ches in the French. K-vec does not depend on sentence boundaries."
A94-1030,Improving {C}hinese Tokenization With Linguistic Filters on Statistical Lexical Acquisition,1994,8,55,2,0,33578,dekai wu,Fourth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing,0,"The first step in Chinese NLP is to tokenize or segment character sequences into words, since the text contains no word delimiters. Recent heavy activity in this area has shown the biggest stumbling block to be words that are absent from the lexicon, since successful tokenizers to date have been based on dictionary lookup (e.g., Chang & Chen 1993; Chiang et al. 1992; Lin et al. 1993; Wu & Tseng 1993; Sproat et al. 1994).We present empirical evidence for four points concerning tokenization of Chinese text: (1) More rigorous blind evaluation methodology is needed to avoid inflated accuracy measurements; we introduce the nk-blind method. (2) The extent of the unknown-word problem is far more serious than generally thought, when tokenizing unrestricted texts in realistic domains. (3) Statistical lexical acquisition is a practical means to greatly improve tokenization accuracy with unknown words, reducing error rates as much as 32.0%. (4) When augmenting the lexicon, linguistic constraints can provide simple inexpensive filters yielding significantly better precision, reducing error rates as much as 49.4%."

DK-vec improves on previous alignment algorithms in that it handles better the non-linear nature of noisy corpora. The algorithm uses frequency, position and recency information as features for pattern matching. Dynamic Time Warping is used as the matching technique between word pairs. This algorithm produces a small bilingual lexicon which provides anchor points for alignment."

In addition, we discuss in detail the individual performance of BYBLOS, the speech recognition (SPREC) component.In the official scoring, conducted by NIST, BBN's HARC system produced a weighted SLS score of 43.7 on all 687 evaluable utterances in the test set. This was the lowest error achieved by any of the 7 systems evaluated.For the SPREC evaluation BBN's BYBLOS system achieved a word error rate of 6.2% on the same 687 utterances and 9.4% on the entire test set of 971 utterances. These results were significantly better than any other speech system evaluated."
