In this work, we employ both principal reward components jointly and propose a method to analyse the resulting behaviour through a structured way of probing the learned policy. We show that blending both reward components increases user satisfaction without sacrificing task success in more hostile environments and provide insight about actions chosen by the learned policies."

In this paper, we propose a general methodology to compute the similarity of two dialogue behaviour models and investigate different ways of computing scores on both the semantic and the textual level. Complementing absolute measures of performance, we test our scores on three different tasks and show the practical usability of the measures."

In this work we assume that discriminative attributes can be detected by discovering the association (or lack of association) between a pair of words. The hypothesis we test in this contribution is whether the semantic difference between two pairs of concepts can be treated in terms of measuring the distance between words in a vector space, or can simply be obtained as a by-product of word co-occurrence counts."

By means of a comparative study of the utterances from the study with interpersonal utterances, we provide criteria what constitutes naturalness in the user input of an state-of-the-art automotive SDS."

The experiments are performed on two German treebanks, using three POS tagsets of different granularity, and six different POS taggers, together with the Berkeley parser. Our findings show that less granularity of the POS tagset leads to better tagging results. However, both too coarse-grained and too fine-grained distinctions on POS level decrease parsing performance."

However, for the evaluation of parser performance concerning a particular phenomenon, a test suite of sentences is needed in which this phenomenon has been identified. In recent years, the parsing of discontinuous structures has received a rising interest. Therefore, in this paper, we present a test suite for testing the performance of dependency and constituency parsers on non-projective dependencies and discontinuous constituents for German. The test suite is based on the newly released TIGER treebank version 2.2. It provides a unique possibility of benchmarking parsers on non-local syntactic relationships in German, for constituents and dependencies. We include a linguistic analysis of the phenomena that cause discontinuity in the TIGER annotation, thereby closing gaps in previous literature. The linguistic phenomena we investigate include extraposition, a placeholder/repeated element construction, topicalization, scrambling, local movement, parentheticals, and fronting of pronouns."

In this paper we present a parser for binary PLCFRS of fan-out two, together with a novel monotonous estimate for A parsing, with which we conduct experiments on modified versions of the German NeGra treebank and the Discontinuous Penn Treebank in which all trees have block degree two.

However, the task has not received much attention in the literature. A major reason for that is that the annotation of major treebanks does not reliably annotate coordination. This makes it virtually impossible to detect coordinations in which two conjuncts are separated by punctuation rather than by a coordinating conjunction. In this paper, we present an annotation scheme for the Penn Treebank which introduces a distinction between coordinating from non-coordinating punctuation. We discuss the general annotation guidelines as well as problematic cases. Eventually, we show that this additional annotation allows the retrieval of a considerable number of coordinate structures beyond the ones having a coordinating conjunction."

In both treebanks, discontinuities are annotated with crossing branches. Based on an evaluation using different metrics, we show that an output quality can be achieved which is comparable to the output quality of PCFG-based systems."

This paper addresses the question how to compare syntactically annotated corpora and gain insights into the usefulness of specific design decisions. We present an exhaustive evaluation of two German treebanks with crucially different encoding schemes. We evaluate three different parsers trained on the two treebanks and compare results using EvalB, the Leaf-Ancestor metric, and a dependency-based evaluation. Furthermore, we present TePaCoC, a new testsuite for the evaluation of parsers on complex German grammatical constructions. The testsuite provides a well thought-out error classification, which enables us to compare parser output for parsers trained on treebanks with different encoding schemes and provides interesting insights into the impact of treebank annotation schemes on specific constructions like PP attachment or non-constituent coordination."

Parser performance for the models trained on TuBa-D/Z are comparable to parsing results for English with the Stanford parser, when trained on the Penn treebank.
