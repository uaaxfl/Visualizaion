However, answering specific research questions with this data is difficult, since fanfiction contains more diverse writing styles than formal fiction. We present a text processing pipeline for fanfiction, with a focus on identifying text associated with characters. The pipeline includes modules for character identification and coreference, as well as the attribution of quotes and narration to those characters. Additionally, the pipeline contains a novel approach to character coreference that uses knowledge from quote attribution to resolve pronouns within quotes. For each module, we evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches on 10 annotated fanfiction stories. This pipeline outperforms tools developed for formal fiction on the tasks of character coreference and quote attribution"

However, the process of exchange between basic NLP and applications is often assumed to emerge naturally, resulting in many innovations going unapplied and many important questions left unstudied. We describe a new paradigm of Translational NLP, which aims to structure and facilitate the processes by which basic and applied NLP research inform one another. Translational NLP thus presents a third research paradigm, focused on understanding the challenges posed by application needs and how these challenges can drive innovation in basic science and technology design. We show that many significant advances in NLP research have emerged from the intersection of basic principles with application needs, and present a conceptual framework outlining the stakeholders and key questions in translational research. Our framework provides a roadmap for developing Translational NLP as a dedicated research area, and identifies general translational principles to facilitate exchange between basic and applied research."

We instantiate our framework on two distinct datasets comprising persuasion and negotiation conversations. We also leverage a hierarchical sequence-labelling neural architecture to infer the aforementioned resisting strategies automatically. Our experiments reveal the asymmetry of power roles in non-collaborative goal-directed conversations and the benefits accrued from incorporating resisting strategies on the final conversation outcome. We also investigate the role of different resisting strategies on the conversation outcome and glean insights that corroborate with past findings. We also make the code and the dataset of this work publicly available at \url{https://github.com/americast/resper}."

We investigate the variability in ideology judgments across annotators, finding evidence that these experiential factors may influence the consistency of how political ideologies are perceived. Finally, we present evidence that understanding how humans perceive and interpret ideology from texts remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art language models, pointing towards potential issues when modeling user experiences that may require more contextual knowledge."

LIW and DAFT improve over a no-transfer BERT baseline on both domains, but ADA only improves on notes. Deeper analysis of performance under different types of shifts (e.g., lexical shift, semantic shift) explains some of the variations among models.

We curate two KG datasets that include biomedical and encyclopedic knowledge and use an existing commonsense KG dataset to explore KG completion in the more realistic setting where dense connectivity is not guaranteed. We develop a deep convolutional network that utilizes textual entity representations and demonstrate that our model outperforms recent KG completion methods in this challenging setting. We find that our model{'}s performance improvements stem primarily from its robustness to sparsity. We then distill the knowledge from the convolutional network into a student network that re-ranks promising candidate entities. This re-ranking stage leads to further improvements in performance and demonstrates the effectiveness of entity re-ranking for KG completion.

Effective designs encode within the layout and formatting signals that point to where the important information can be found. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that leverages these multi-modal signals to aid in the KPE task. In particular, we leverage both lexical and visual features (e.g., size, font, position) at the micro-level to enable effective strategy induction and meta-level features that describe pages at a macro-level to aid in strategy selection. Our evaluation demonstrates that a combination of effective strategy induction and strategy selection within this approach for the KPE task outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Modeling face and understanding its state changes throughout a conversation is critical to the study of maintenance of basic human needs in and through interaction. Grounded in the politeness theory of Brown and Levinson (1978), we propose a generalized framework for modeling face acts in persuasion conversations, resulting in a reliable coding manual, an annotated corpus, and computational models. The framework reveals insights about differences in face act utilization between asymmetric roles in persuasion conversations. Using computational models, we are able to successfully identify face acts as well as predict a key conversational outcome (e.g. donation success). Finally, we model a latent representation of the conversational state to analyze the impact of predicted face acts on the probability of a positive conversational outcome and observe several correlations that corroborate previous findings."

The challenges may differ between utterances depending on the role of the speaker within the conversation, especially when relevant expertise is distributed asymmetrically across roles. Further, the challenges may also increase over the conversation as more shared context is built up through information communicated implicitly earlier in the dialogue. In this paper, we propose the novel modeling approach MedFilter, which addresses these insights in order to increase performance at identifying and categorizing task-relevant utterances, and in so doing, positively impacts performance at a downstream information extraction task. We evaluate this approach on a corpus of nearly 7,000 doctor-patient conversations where MedFilter is used to identify medically relevant contributions to the discussion (achieving a 10{\%} improvement over SOTA baselines in terms of area under the PR curve). Identifying task-relevant utterances benefits downstream medical processing, achieving improvements of 15{\%}, 105{\%}, and 23{\%} respectively for the extraction of symptoms, medications, and complaints."

In the proposed approach, type information serves both to (1) improve mention representation and (2) create a soft type consistency check between coreference candidate mentions. Our evaluation covers two different grain sizes of types over four different benchmark corpora."

This restricts the ability of systems to learn temporal links between global pairs, since reliance on local syntactic features suffices to achieve reasonable performance on existing datasets. However, systems should be capable of incorporating cues from document-level structure to assign temporal relations. In this work, we take a first step towards discourse-level temporal ordering by creating TDDiscourse, the first dataset focusing specifically on temporal links between event pairs which are more than one sentence apart. We create TDDiscourse by augmenting TimeBank-Dense, a corpus of English news articles, manually annotating global pairs that cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations. Our annotations double the number of temporal links in TimeBank-Dense, while possessing several desirable properties such as focusing on long-distance pairs and not being automatically inferable. We adapt and benchmark the performance of three state-of-the-art models on TDDiscourse and observe that existing systems indeed find discourse-level temporal ordering harder."

We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, finding that right-leaning users invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how content policies are applied. Overall, we argue for a more nuanced approach to moderation by highlighting the intersection of behavior and ideology in considering how abusive language is defined and regulated."

Inspired by cognitive studies on how humans perceive numbers, we develop an analysis framework to test how well word embeddings capture two essential properties of numbers: magnitude (e.g. 3{\textless}4) and numeration (e.g. 3=three). Our experiments reveal that most models capture an approximate notion of magnitude, but are inadequate at capturing numeration.

Experiments conducted on one MOOC show that thread resolveability connects closely to our proposed five dimensions and that the predictive ensemble model gives better performance over several baselines."

To computationally model discourse and social positioning in metaphor, we need a corpus annotated with metaphors relevant to speaker intentions. This paper reports a corpus study as a first step towards computational work on social and discourse functions of metaphor. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate data from three web discussion forums covering distinct domains. We then compare these to annotations from our own annotation scheme which distinguish levels of metaphor with the labels: nonliteral, conventionalized, and literal. Our hope is that this work raises questions about what new work needs to be done in order to address the question of how metaphors are used to achieve social goals in interaction."

We then build on that result in predicting how members of different gangs signal the relationship between their gangs within threads where they are interacting with one another, with a predictive accuracy as high as 66% at this thread composition prediction task. Our work demonstrates how graffiti style features signal social identity both in terms of personal group affiliation and between group alliances and oppositions. When we predict thread composition by modeling identity and relationship simultaneously using a multi-domain learning framework paired with a rich feature representation, we achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines using one or the other in isolation."

Important behavioral categories, though, are often sparse and often appear only in specific subsections of a conversation. This makes supervised machine learning difficult, through a combination of noisy features and unbalanced class distributions. We propose within-instance content selection, using cue features to selectively suppress sections of text and biasing the remaining representation towards minority classes. We show the effectiveness of this technique in automated annotation of empowerment language in online support group chatrooms. Our technique is significantly more accurate than multiple baselines, especially when prioritizing high precision."

To understand the interplay between social positioning, information sharing, and rhetorical strategy in language, various granularities are necessary. In this work we present a machine learning model for multi-party chat which predicts conversation structure across differing units of analysis. First, we mark sentence-level behavior using an information sharing annotation scheme. By taking advantage of Integer Linear Programming and a sociolinguistic framework, we enforce structural relationships between sentence-level annotations and sequences of interaction. Then, we show that clustering these sequences can effectively disentangle the threads of conversation. This model is highly accurate, performing near human accuracy, and performs analysis on-line, opening the door to real-time analysis of the discourse of conversation."

Models of stylistic shift that focus on specific features are limited in terms of the contexts to which they can be applied if the goal of the analysis is to model socially motivated speech style accommodation. In this paper, we present an unsupervised Dynamic Bayesian Model that allows us to model stylistic style accommodation in a way that is agnostic to which specific speech style features will shift in a way that resembles socially motivated stylistic variation. This greatly expands the applicability of the model across contexts. Our hypothesis is that stylistic shifts that occur as a result of social processes are likely to display some consistency over time, and if we leverage this insight in our model, we will achieve a model that better captures inherent structure within speech."

First, many multidomain learning algorithms resemble ensemble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain learning improvements the result of ensemble learning effects? Second, these algorithms are traditionally evaluated in a balanced class label setting, although in practice many multi-domain settings have domain-specific class label biases. When multi-domain learning is applied to these settings, (2) are multidomain methods improving because they capture domain-specific class biases? An understanding of these two issues presents a clearer idea about where the field has had success in multi-domain learning, and it suggests some important open questions for improving beyond the current state of the art."

While structural features offer much in terms of expressive power over simpler features used more frequently in machine learning approaches to modeling linguistic variation, they frequently come at an excessive cost in terms of feature space size expansion. We propose a novel form of structural features referred to as stretchy patterns that strike a balance between expressive power and compactness in order to enable modeling stylistic variation with reasonably small datasets. As an example we focus on the problem of modeling variation related to gender in personal blogs. Our evaluation demonstrates a significant improvement over standard baselines."

These strategies help the tutor agent manage the attention of the students while delivering useful instructional content. Two technical challenges involving the use of social interaction strategies include determining the appropriate policy for triggering these strategies and regulating the amount of social behavior performed by the tutor. In this paper, a comparison of six different triggering policies is presented. We find that a triggering policy learnt from human behavior in combination with a filter that keeps the amount of social behavior comparable to that performed by human tutors offers the most effective solution to the these challenges."

Effective features include both stylistic ones (such as POS patterns) as well as content oriented ones. Using a linear regression model based on shallow text features, we obtain correlations up to 0.74 and mean absolute errors between 4.1 and 6.8 years."

Most current tutorial dialogue systems are text based (Evens et al., 2001; Rose and Aleven, 2002; Zinn et al., 2002; Aleven et al., 2001; VanLehn et al., 2002). However, prior studies have shown considerable benefits of tutoring through spoken interactions (Lemke, 1990; Chi et al., 1994; Hausmann and Chi, 2002). Thus, we are currently developing a speech based dialogue system that uses a text based system for tutoring conceptual physics (VanLehn et al., 2002) as its back-end. In order to explore the relative effectiveness between these two input modalities in our task domain, we have started by collecting parallel human-human tutoring corpora both for text based and speech based tutoring. In both cases, students interact with the tutor through a web interface. We present here a comparison between the two on a number of features of dialogue that have been demonstrated to correlate reliably with learning gains with students interacting with the tutor using the text based interface (Rose et al., submitted)."

W94-0113,Recovering From Parser Failures: A Hybrid Statistical/Symbolic Approach,1994,2,8,1,1,2584,carolyn rose,The Balancing Act: Combining Symbolic and Statistical Approaches to Language,0,"W~ describe an implementation of a hybrid statistical/symbolic approach to repairing parser failures in a speech-to-speech translation system. I We describe a rnodale which takes as input a fragmented parse and reeturas a repaired meaning representation. It negotiates with the speaker about what the complete meaning of the utterance is by generating hypotheses about how to fit. the fragments of the partial parse together into a colwrcnt meaning representation. By drawing upon both statistical and symbolic information, it constrains its rcpair hypotheses to those which are both likely and meaningful. Because it updates its statistical model during use, it improves its performance over time."
