This approach, a type of analogical learning, was attractive because of its simplicity; and the paper reported considerable success with the method using various language pairs. In this paper, we describe our attempt to use this approach for tackling English-Hindi Named Entity (NE) Transliteration. We have implemented our own EBMT system using proportional analogy and have found that the analogy-based system on its own has low precision but a high recall due to the fact that a large number of names are untransliterated with the approach. However, mitigating problems in analogy-based EBMT with SMT and vice-versa have shown considerable improvement over the individual approach."

The paper points out that the pathway to healthcare for such patients extends beyond the focal point of a doctor-patient dialogue with a GP as it is conventionally portrayed, to include interaction at various stages with a range of medical specialists and nonspecialists. The translation needs (both spoken and text) vary accordingly. The paper then critically reviews work done so far on SLT in the medical domain, in particular considering the most appropriate set up - who is the principal user, doctor or patient? - and at some factors in the deployment of multimodal interfaces to support the speech input. Finally the paper discusses whether SLT is really the most appropriate technology, and discuss some of the barriers to implementation, especially considering the fact that in many cases the languages spoken by the kinds of patients we are targeting happen also to be languages of least interest to commercial developers of language technologies."

We first discuss the user profile for medical SLT, criticizing designs which assume that the doctor will necessarily need or want to control the technology. If patients are to be users on an equal standing, more attention must be paid to usability issues. We focus briefly on the issue of feedback in SLT systems, pointing out the difficulties of relying on text-based paraphrases. We consider the delicate issue of evaluating medical SLT systems, noting that some of the standard and much-used evaluation techniques for all aspects of the SLT chain might not be suitable for use with real users, even if they are role-playing. Finally, we discuss the idea that the pathway to healthcare involves much more than a face-to-face interview with a medical professional, and that different technologies including but not restricted to SLT will be appropriate along this pathway."

This paper describes the factors which determine the choice of a suitable BL for a given TL, and describe an experiment with a fake Somali TTS system evaluated in the real-life situation of a doctorÂpatient dialogue. 28 Somali participants were asked to judge the comprehensibility of 25 short Somali sentences recorded with a German TTS system.

In the second, we ask whether RTT can predict the translatability of a given text. In both cases, we find RTT to be a poor predictor of quality, with high BLEU and F-scores for RTTs when the forward translation was poor. We discuss why this is the case, and conclude that, even if it seemed obvious that RTT was good for nothing, at least we now have some tangible evidence."

This paper proposes and illustrates an evaluation methodology for this noisy channel which tries to quantify the relative amount of degradation in translation quality due to each of the contributing modules. A small pilot experiment involving word-accuracy rate for the SR, and a fidelity evaluation for the MT and SS modules is proposed in which subjects are asked to paraphrase translated and/or synthesised sentences from a tourist{'}s phrasebook. Results show (as expected) that MT is the {``}noisiest{''} channel, with SS contributing least noise. The concatenation of the three channels is worse than could be predicted from the performance of each as individual tasks."

This technique, which involves masking some words in a text, and then asking subjects to guess the missing words, was used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evaluation method, but no more recent use has been reported, even though the methodology is simple to implement and provides an objective result. We report here two experiments in which we tested three MT systems against a human translation, with texts from three different genres, to see whether the procedure can be used to rank MT systems against each other. The paper discusses some details of the procedure which provide important variables to the test, notably what percentage of words are masked, and whether the scoring procedure should be right-wrong, or should differentiate between different degrees of wrong answer (crediting close synonyms and other plausible near-misses). We discuss other aspects of the procedure which may affect the test's usability. Especially of interest is the fact that there seems to be a lower quality threshold below which the procedure is less discriminatory: the translation is so bad that the subjects cannot make reasonable guesses at all.

Different types of documentation style are discussed, as well as different user profiles. It is found that documentation is often inadequate in identifying the level of linguistic background and knowledge necessary to use translation software, and in explaining technical (linguistic) terms needed to use the software effectively. In particular, the level of knowledge and training needed to use the software is often incompatible with the user profile implied by the documentation. Also, guidance on how to perform more complex tasks, which may be especially idiosyncratic, is often inadequate or missing altogether."

This paper evaluates some of the most widely used statistical measures and introduces a method that can identify significant bigrams in relatively small texts by adapting Fung and Church's (1994) K-vec algorithm, which was originally designed to extract word correspondences from unaligned parallel corpora. The proposed method captures the linguistic generalisation abou lexical patterning in texts and can identify recurrent co-occurring word sequences, which might be phrases, terms, or unknown words. In addition, it has the potential of identifying key phrases and terms that reveal topicality in a text."
W98-1216,An Attempt to Use Weighted Cusums to Identify Sublanguages,1998,13,14,1,1,45023,harold somers,New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,0,"This paper explores the use of weighted cusums, a technique found in authorship attribution studies, for the purpose of identifying sublanguages. The technique, and its relation to standard cusums (cumulative sum charts) is first described, and the formulae for calculations given in detail. The technique compares texts by testing for the incidence of linguistic 'features' of a superficial nature, e.g. proportion of 2- and 3-letter words, words beginning with a vowel, and so on, and measures whether two texts differ significantly in respect of these features. The paper describes an experiment in which 14 groups of three texts each representing different sublanguages are compared with each other using the technique. The texts are first compared within each group to establish that the technique can identify the groups as being homogeneous. The texts are then compared with each other, and the results analysed. Taking the average of seven different tests, the technique is able to distinguish the sublanguages in only 43% of the case. But if the best score is taken, 79% of pairings can be distinguished. This is a better result, and the test seems able to quantify the difference between sublanguages."

Background This paper concerns the implementation and testing of similarity metrics for the alignment of phonetic segments in transcriptions of children's (mis)articulations with the adult model. This has an obvious application in the development of software to assist speech and language clinicians to assess clients and to plan therapy. This paper will give some of the background to this general problem, but will focus on the computational and linguistic aspect of the alignment problem. 1.1. Articulation testing It is well known that a child's acquisition of phonology is gradual, and can be charted according to the appearance of phonetic distinctions (e.g. stops vs. fricatives), the disappearance of childish lnispronunciations, especially due to assimilation ([gtN] for dog), and the ability to articulate particular phonetic configurations (e.g. consonant clusters). Whether screening whole populations of children, or assessing individual referrals, the articulation test is an important tool for the speech clinician. A child's articulatory development is usually described with reference to an adult model, and in terms of deviations from it: a number of phonological processes can be identified, and their significance with respect to the chronological age of the child assessed. Often processes interact, e.g. when spoon is pronounced [mun] we have consonant-cluster reduction and assimilation. The problem for this paper is to align the segments in the transcription of the child's articulation with the target model pronunciation. The task is complicated by the need to identify cases of metathesis, where the corresponding sounds have been reordered (e.g. remember -- [mtremb~]) and merges, a special case of consonant-cluster reduction where the resulting segment has some of the features of both elements in the original cluster (e.g. sleep , [tip]). It would be appropriate here to review the software currently available to speech clinicians, but lack of space prevents us fi'om doing so (see Somers, forthcoming). Suffice it to say that software does exist, but is mainly for grammatical and lexical analysis. Of the tiny number of programs which specifically address the problem of articulation testing, none, as far as one can tell, involve automatic alignment of the data."

It is argued that neither of these models was originally developed with this use in mind, and both must be adapted somewhat to meet this purpose. In particular, the traditional Valency distinction of complements and adjuncts leads to conflicts when valency frames in different languages are compared: a finer but more flexible distinction is required. Also, these concepts must be extended beyond the verb, to include the noun and adjective as valency bearers. As far as Case is concerned, too narrow an approach has traditionally been taken: work in this field has been too conerned only with cases for arguments in verb frames; case label systems for non-valency bound elements and also for elements in nominal groups must be elaborated. The paper suggests an integrated approach specifically oriented towards the particular problems found in MT."
A83-1026,Investigating the Possibility of a Microprocessor-Based Machine Translatton System,1983,16,0,1,1,45023,harold somers,First Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing,0,"This paper describes an on-going research project being carried out by staff and students at the Centre for Computational Linguistics to examine the feasibility of Machine Translation (MT) in a microprocessor environment. The system incorporates as far as possible features of large-scale MT systems that have proved desirable or effective: it is multilingual, algorithms and data are strictly separated, and the system is highly modular. Problems of terminological polysemy and syntactic complexity are reduced via the notions of controlled vocabulary and restricted syntax. Given these constraints, it seems feasible to achieve translation via an 'interlingua', avoiding any language-pair oriented 'transfer' stage. The paper concentrates on a description of the separate modules in the translation process as they are currently envisaged, and details some of the problems specific to the microprocessor-based approach to MT that have so far come to light."
