In this work, we propose and argue for a novel cross-lingual transfer paradigm: instance-level parser selection (ILPS), and present a proof-of-concept study focused on instance-level selection in the framework of delexicalized parser transfer. Our work is motivated by an empirical observation that different source parsers are the best choice for different Universal POS-sequences (i.e., UPOS sentences) in the target language. We then propose to predict the best parser at the instance level. To this end, we train a supervised regression model, based on the Transformer architecture, to predict parser accuracies for individual POS-sequences. We compare ILPS against two strong single-best parser selection baselines (SBPS): (1) a model that compares POS n-gram distributions between the source and target languages (KL) and (2) a model that selects the source based on the similarity between manually created language vectors encoding syntactic properties of languages (L2V). The results from our extensive evaluation, coupling 42 source parsers and 20 diverse low-resource test languages, show that ILPS outperforms KL and L2V on 13/20 and 14/20 test languages, respectively. Further, we show that by predicting the best parser {``}at treebank level{''} (SBPS), using the aggregation of predictions from our instance-level model, we outperform the same baselines on 17/20 and 16/20 test languages."

We propose a novel multimodal approach to real-time sequence labeling in speech. Our model treats speech and its own textual representation as two separate modalities or views, as it jointly learns from streamed audio and its noisy transcription into text via automatic speech recognition. Our results show significant gains of jointly learning from the two modalities when compared to text or audio only, under adverse noise and limited volume of training data. The results generalize to medical symptoms detection where we observe a similar pattern of improvements with multimodal learning."

We measure the correlation between their judgments and a range of parse evaluation metrics across five languages. The humanmetric correlation is lower for dependency parsing than for other NLP tasks. Also, inter-annotator agreement is sometimes higher than the agreement between judgments and metrics, indicating that the standard metrics fail to capture certain aspects of parse quality, such as the relevance of root attachment or the relative importance of the different parts of speech."

Its underlying idea is to make use of existing tools and annotations in resource-rich languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor languages. Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel corpora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a target language. In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine translation to create synthetic training data from the original source-side annotations. Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing, using a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation. Our approach draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy source-side annotation of an unrelated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers. We show that this approach significantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing.% despite the error-prone translation step."

Beside the tagger, for purposes of both training and testing, we had at our disposal only a 100 Kw Croatia Weekly newspaper subcorpus, manually tagged using approximately 1000 different MULTEXT-East v3 morphosyntactic tags. The test basically consisted of randomly assigning a variable size portion of the corpus for the taggerÂs training procedure and also another fixed-size portion, sized at 10{\%} of the corpus, for the tagging procedure itself; this method allowed us not only to provide preliminary results regarding tagger accuracy on Croatian texts, but also to inspect the behavior of the stochastic tagging paradigm in general. The results were then taken from the test case providing 90{\%} of the corpus for training purposes and varied from around 86{\%} in the worst case scenario up to a peak of around 95{\%} correctly assigned full MSD tags. Results on PoS only expectedly reached the human error level, with TnT correctly tagging above 98{\%} of test sets on average. Most MSD errors occurred on types with the highest number of candidate tags per word form Â nouns, pronouns and adjectives Â while errors on PoS, although following the same pattern, were almost insignificant. Detailed insight on tagging, F-measure for all PoS categories is provided in the course of the paper along with other facts of interest."
