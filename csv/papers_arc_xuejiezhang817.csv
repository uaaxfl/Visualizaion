In this paper, a transformer-based model with auxiliary information is proposed for SemEval-2021 Task 5. The proposed model was implemented based on the BERT-CRF architecture. It consists of three parts: a transformer-based model that can obtain the token representation, an auxiliary information module that combines features from different layers, and an output layer used for the classification. Various BERT-based models, such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET, were used to learn contextual representations. The predictions of these models were assembled to improve the sequence labeling tasks by using a voting strategy. Experimental results showed that the introduced auxiliary information can improve the performance of toxic spans detection. The proposed model ranked 5th of 91 in the competition.

Recent studies used attention-based methods that can effectively improve the performance of aspect-level sentiment analysis. These methods ignored the syntactic relationship between the aspect and its corresponding context words, leading the model to focus on syntactically unrelated words mistakenly. One proposed solution, the graph convolutional network (GCN), cannot completely avoid the problem. While it does incorporate useful information about syntax, it assigns equal weight to all the edges between connected words. It may still incorrectly associate unrelated words to the target aspect through the iterations of graph convolutional propagation. In this study, a graph attention network with memory fusion is proposed to extend GCN{'}s idea by assigning different weights to edges. Syntactic constraints can be imposed to block the graph convolutional propagation of unrelated words. A convolutional layer and a memory fusion were applied to learn and exploit multiword relations and draw different weights of words to improve performance further. Experimental results on five datasets show that the proposed method yields better performance than existing methods."

Therefore, this study proposes a word vector refinement model that can be applied to any pre-trained word vectors (e.g., Word2vec and GloVe). The refinement model is based on adjusting the vector representations of words such that they can be closer to both semantically and sentimentally similar words and further away from sentimentally dissimilar words.

Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process.

P15-2129,Predicting Valence-Arousal Ratings of Words Using a Weighted Graph Method,2015,26,18,4,0,2441,liangchih yu,Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers),0,"Compared to the categorical approach that represents affective states as several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative), the dimensional approach represents affective states as continuous numerical values on multiple dimensions, such as the valence-arousal (VA) space, thus allowing for more fine-grained sentiment analysis. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words. Experiments on both English and Chinese affective lexicons show that the proposed method yielded a smaller error rate on VA prediction than the linear regression, kernel method, and pagerank algorithm used in previous studies."
