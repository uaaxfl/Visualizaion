In this paper, we propose zero-shot instance-weighting, a general model-agnostic zero-shot learning framework for improving CLTC by leveraging source instance weighting. It adds a module on top of pre-trained language models for similarity computation of instance weights, thus aligning each source instance to the target language. During training, the framework utilizes gradient descent that is weighted by instance weights to update parameters. We evaluate this framework over seven target languages on three fundamental tasks and show its effectiveness and extensibility, by improving on F1 score up to 4{\%} in single-source transfer and 8{\%} in multi-source transfer. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to apply instance weighting in zero-shot CLTC. It is simple yet effective and easily extensible into multi-source transfer."

Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and spoken dialogue systems by utilizing techniques including tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion, and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing.

However, these models are typically fine-tuned on hundreds of thousands of data points, an infeasible requirement when applying summarization to new, niche domains. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable method, called WikiTransfer, for fine-tuning pretrained models for summarization in an unsupervised, dataset-specific manner. WikiTransfer fine-tunes pretrained models on pseudo-summaries, produced from generic Wikipedia data, which contain characteristics of the target dataset, such as the length and level of abstraction of the desired summaries. WikiTransfer models achieve state-of-the-art, zero-shot abstractive summarization performance on the CNN-DailyMail dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three additional diverse datasets. These models are more robust to noisy data and also achieve better or comparable few-shot performance using 10 and 100 training examples when compared to few-shot transfer from other summarization datasets. To further boost performance, we employ data augmentation via round-trip translation as well as introduce a regularization term for improved few-shot transfer. To understand the role of dataset aspects in transfer performance and the quality of the resulting output summaries, we further study the effect of the components of our unsupervised fine-tuning data and analyze few-shot performance using both automatic and human evaluation."

In order to satisfy the needs of different types of users, we define a new query-based multi-domain meeting summarization task, where models have to select and summarize relevant spans of meetings in response to a query, and we introduce QMSum, a new benchmark for this task.

In this work, we perform a comprehensive study on long dialogue summarization by investigating three strategies to deal with the lengthy input problem and locate relevant information: (1) extended transformer models such as Longformer, (2) retrieve-then-summarize pipeline models with several dialogue utterance retrieval methods, and (3) hierarchical dialogue encoding models such as HMNet. Our experimental results on three long dialogue datasets (QMSum, MediaSum, SummScreen) show that the retrieve-then-summarize pipeline models yield the best performance. We also demonstrate that the summary quality can be further improved with a stronger retrieval model and pretraining on proper external summarization datasets."

To build the ultimate artificial intelligence, we desire a single machine that can handle diverse new problems, for which task-specific annotations are limited. We bring up textual entailment as a unified solver for such NLP problems. However, current research of textual entailment has not spilled much ink on the following questions: (i) How well does a pretrained textual entailment system generalize across domains with only a handful of domain-specific examples? and (ii) When is it worth transforming an NLP task into textual entailment? We argue that the transforming is unnecessary if we can obtain rich annotations for this task. Textual entailment really matters particularly when the target NLP task has insufficient annotations. Universal NLP can be probably achieved through different routines. In this work, we introduce Universal Few-shot textual Entailment (UFO-Entail). We demonstrate that this framework enables a pretrained entailment model to work well on new entailment domains in a few-shot setting, and show its effectiveness as a unified solver for several downstream NLP tasks such as question answering and coreference resolution when the end-task annotations are limited."

More than 5,000 readers submit captions for it. The editors select three of them and ask the readers to pick the funniest one. We describe an experiment that compares a dozen automatic methods for selecting the funniest caption.

We propose a method for identifying the sentiment polarity of words that applies a Markov random walk model to a large word relatedness graph, and produces a polarity estimate for any given word. The model can accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign and magnitude to any word. It can be used both in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in a weakly supervised setting where only a handful of seed words is used to define the two polarity classes. The method is experimentally tested using a gold standard set of positive and negative words from the General Inquirer lexicon. We also show how our method can be used for three-way classification which identifies neutral words in addition to positive and negative words. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the semi-supervised setting and is comparable to the best reported values in the weakly supervised setting. In addition, the proposed method is faster and does not need a large corpus. We also present extensions of our methods for identifying the polarity of foreign words and out-of-vocabulary words."
W13-3403,Introducing Computational Concepts in a Linguistics Olympiad,2013,5,1,4,0,12351,patrick littell,Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Teaching {NLP} and {CL},0,"Linguistics olympiads, now offered in more than 20 countries, provide secondary-school students a compelling introduction to an unfamiliar field. The North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) includes computational puzzles in addition to purely linguistic ones. This paper explores the computational subject matter we seek to convey via NACLO, as well as some of the challenges that arise when adapting problems in computational linguistics to an audience that may have no background in computer science, linguistics, or advanced mathematics. We present a small library of reusable design patterns that have proven useful when composing puzzles appropriate for secondary-school students. 1 What is a Linguistics Olympiad? A linguistics olympiad (LO) (Payne and Derzhanski, 2010) is a puzzle contest for secondary-school students in which contestants compete to solve self-contained linguistics problem sets. LOs have their origin in the Moscow Traditional Olympiad in Linguistics, established in 1965, and have since spread around the world; an international contest (http://www.ioling.org) has been held yearly since 2003. In an LO, every problem set is self-contained, so no prior experience in linguistics is necessary to compete. In fact, LO contests are fun and rewarding for exactly this reason: by the end of the contest, contestants are managing to read hieroglyphics, conjugate verbs in Swahili, and perform other amazing feats. Furthermore, they have accomplished this solely through their own analytical abilities and linguistic intuition. Based on our experience going into high schools and presenting our material, this xe2x80x9clinguisticxe2x80x9d way of thinking about languages almost always comes as a novel surprise to students. They largely think about languages as collections of known facts that you learn in classes and from books, not something that you can dive into and figure out for yourself. This is a hands-on antidote to the common public misconception that linguists are fundamentally polyglots, rather than language scientists, and students come out of the experience having realized that linguistics is a very different field (and hopefully a more compelling one) than they had assumed it to be. 2 Computational Linguistics at the LO Our goal, since starting the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) in 2007 (Radev et al., 2008), has been to explore how this LO experience can be used to introduce students to computational linguistics. Topics in computational linguistics have been featured before in LOs, occasionally in the Moscow LO and with some regularity in the Bulgarian LO. Our deliberations began with some troubling statistics regarding enrollments in computer science programs (Zweben, 2013). Between 2003 and 2007 enrollments in computer science dropped dramatically. This was attributed in part to the dip in the IT sector, but it also stemmed in"

Our approach divides this problem into two steps, using a graph-based approach for each step: (1) factoid discovery, finding groups of words that correspond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid assignment, using these groups of words to mark collective discourse units that contain the respective factoids.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for automatically detecting discussant subgroups in online communities. We analyze the text exchanged between the participants of a discussion to identify the attitude they carry toward each other and towards the various aspects of the discussion topic.

Attitude predictions are used to construct a signed network representation of the discussion thread. In this network, each discussant is represented by a node. An edge connects two discussants if they exchanged posts. The sign (positive or negative) of the edge is set based on the polarity of the attitude identified in the text associated with the edge.

For instance, when a citing sentence is used in a summary of a scientific paper, only the fragments of the sentence that are relevant to the summarized paper should be included in the summary. In this paper, we present and compare three different approaches for identifying the fragments of a citing sentence that are related to a given target reference.

However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories. Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them."

Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Finally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations."

We formulate the first sub-problem as a supervised classification task, where we classify the potential keywords as real speculation keywords or not by using a diverse set of linguistic features that represent the contexts of the keywords. After detecting the actual speculation keywords, we use the syntactic structures of the sentences to determine their scopes."

A cluster of such texts typically exhibits instances of paraphrase and contradiction, as sources update the facts surrounding the story, often due to an ongoing investigation. The current hypothesis is that the stories ÂevolveÂ over time, beginning with the first text published on a given topic. This is tested using a phylogenetic approach as well as one based on language modeling. The fit of the evolutionary models is evaluated with respect to how well they facilitate the recovery of chronological relationships between the documents. Over all data clusters, the language modeling approach consistently outperforms the phylogenetics model. However, on manually collected clusters in which the documents are published within short time spans of one another, both have a similar performance, and produce statistically significant results on the document chronology recovery evaluation."
C08-1040,Tracking the Dynamic Evolution of Participants Salience in a Discussion,2008,19,7,7,1,576,ahmed hassan,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008),0,We introduce a technique for analyzing the temporal evolution of the salience of participants in a discussion. Our method can dynamically track how the relative importance of speakers evolve over time using graph based techniques. Speaker salience is computed based on the eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of participants in a discussion. Two participants in a discussion are linked with an edge if they use similar rhetoric. The method is dynamic in the sense that the graph evolves over time to capture the evolution inherent to the participants salience. We used our method to track the salience of members of the US Senate using data from the US Congressional Record. Our analysis investigated how the salience of speakers changes over time. Our results show that the scores can capture speaker centrality in topics as well as events that result in change of salience or influence among different participants.

We use pointwise Kullback-Leibler divergence along with the Jaccard coefficient to build a topic graph which represents the community structure of the different facets. The problem is formulated as a weighted set cover problem with dynamically varying weights. The algorithm is domain-independent and generates a representative set of informative and discriminative phrases that cover the entire event. We evaluate this algorithm on a large collection of blog postings about different news events and report promising results.

Our approach is based on the analysis of the paths between two protein names in the dependency parse trees of the sentences. Given two dependency trees, we define two separate similarity functions (kernels) based on cosine similarity and edit distance among the paths between the protein names. Using these similarity functions, we investigate the performances of two classes of learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and k-nearest-neighbor, and the semisupervised counterparts of these algorithms, transductive SVMs and harmonic functions, respectively. Significant improvement over the previous results in the literature is reported as well as a new benchmark dataset is introduced. Semi-supervised algorithms perform better than their supervised version by a wide margin especially when the amount of labeled data is limited."

Prior work falls into two categories, depending on the type of input used: (a) parallel corpora (e.g., multiple translations of the same text) or (b) comparable texts (non-parallel but on the same topic). So far, only techniques based on parallel texts have successfully used syntactic information to guide alignments. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for incorporating syntactic features in the alignment process for non-parallel texts with the goal of generating novel paraphrases of existing texts. Our method uses dynamic programming with alignment decision based on the local syntactic similarity between two sentences. Our results show that syntactic alignment outrivals syntax-free methods by 20% in both grammaticality and fidelity when computed over the novel sentences generated by alignment-induced finite state automata."

Annotators generated a list of questions central to understanding each story in our corpus. Because of the dynamic nature of the stories, many questions are time-sensitive (e.g. How many victims have been found?) Judges found sentences providing an answer to each question. To address the sentence retrieval problem, we apply a stochastic, graph-based method for comparing the relative importance of the textual units, which was previously used successfully for generic summarization. Currently, we present a topic-sensitive version of our method and hypothesize that it can outperform a competitive baseline, which compares the similarity of each sentence to the input question via IDF-weighted word overlap. In our experiments, the method achieves a TRDR score that is significantly higher than that of the baseline."

By picking the sentence that increased the size of the summary the most, we hypothesized that the summary will gain the sentence with the most new information. This hypothesis was found to be true in many cases and to varying degrees in this study."

Based on this correlation, we have developed a technique for automatic lexical choice of descriptions of entities in text generation. We discuss the underlying relationship between the pragmatics of choosing an appropriate description that serves a specific purpose in the automatically generated text and the semantics of the description itself. We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of linguistic structures that are automatically extracted from large corpora. We present a formal evaluation of our approach and we conclude with some thoughts on potential applications of our method."

We present a prototype system called PROFILE which uses a client-server architecture to extract noun-phrase descriptions of entities such as people, places, and organizations. The system serves two purposes: as an information extraction tool, it allows users to search for textual descriptions of entities; as a utility to generate functional descriptions (FD), it is used in a functional-unification based generation system. We present an evaluation of the approach and its applications to natural language generation and summarization."
