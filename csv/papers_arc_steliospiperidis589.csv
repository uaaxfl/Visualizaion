The only option to enable and to benefit from multilingualism is through Language Technologies (LT), i.e., Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies. We describe the European Language Grid (ELG), which is targeted to evolve into the primary platform and marketplace for LT in Europe by providing one umbrella platform for the European LT landscape, including research and industry, enabling all stakeholders to upload, share and distribute their services, products and resources. At the end of our EU project, which will establish a legal entity in 2022, the ELG will provide access to approx. 1300 services for all European languages as well as thousands of data sets."

While the last decade has seen various initiatives that created a multitude of approaches and technologies tailored to Europe{'}s specific needs, there is still an immense level of fragmentation. At the same time, AI has become an increasingly important concept in the European Information and Communication Technology area. For a few years now, AI {--} including many opportunities, synergies but also misconceptions {--} has been overshadowing every other topic. We present an overview of the European LT landscape, describing funding programmes, activities, actions and challenges in the different countries with regard to LT, including the current state of play in industry and the LT market.

However, European LT business is also fragmented {--} by nation states, languages, verticals and sectors, significantly holding back its impact. The European Language Grid (ELG) project addresses this fragmentation by establishing the ELG as the primary platform for LT in Europe. The ELG is a scalable cloud platform, providing, in an easy-to-integrate way, access to hundreds of commercial and non-commercial LTs for all European languages, including running tools and services as well as data sets and resources. Once fully operational, it will enable the commercial and non-commercial European LT community to deposit and upload their technologies and data sets into the ELG, to deploy them through the grid, and to connect with other resources. The ELG will boost the Multilingual Digital Single Market towards a thriving European LT community, creating new jobs and opportunities. Furthermore, the ELG project organises two open calls for up to 20 pilot projects. It also sets up 32 national competence centres and the European LT Council for outreach and coordination purposes."

The research goal in this paper is to re-examine Verbal Aggression as an indicator of xenophobic attitudes in Greek Twitter three years later, in order to trace possible changes regarding the main targets, the types and the content of the verbal attacks against the same targets in the post crisis era, given also the ongoing refugee crisis and the political landscape in Greece as it was shaped after the elections in 2019. The results indicate an interesting rearrangement of the main targets of the verbal attacks, while the content and the types of the attacks provide valuable insights about the way these targets are being framed as compared to the respective dominant perceptions and stereotypes about them during the period 2013-2016."

Finally, few recommendations are provided towards the design of general strategies and an overall coordination for the field of LRs (section 3). 1. The Strategic Role of LRs Language Resources (LRs) xe2x80x93 Written, Spoken and, recently, Multimodal xe2x80x93 are a central and strategic component of the so-called xe2x80x9clinguistic infrastructurexe2x80x9d (the other key element being Evaluation), necessary for the development of any Human Language Technology (HLT) application and product. The availability of adequate LRs for as many languages as possible is a pre-requisite for the development of a truly multilingual Information Society. They play a critical role, as horizontal technology, in different areas of the 6 Framework Programme, and have been recognized as a priority within a number of national projects around Europe. The availability of LRs is also a xe2x80x9csensitivexe2x80x9d issue, touching directly the sphere of linguistic and cultural identity, but also with economical, societal and political implications. This is going to be even more true in the new Europe with 25 languages on a par. The ENABLER Thematic Network of HLT National Projects in European countries xe2x80x93 an EC funded IST project, designed and started by Antonio Zampolli, with a clear strategic vision for the field of LRs xe2x80x93 is the first broad European initiative which has the mission of explicitly considering together the technical, organizational, strategic and political issues of LRs. In ENABLER these various aspects are put together in a coherent framework, to set up mediumand long-term set of priorities (both technical and strategic) and to promote these at the national and international levels. Moreover, ENABLER has recognized the importance to promote actions aiming at integrating the different resource types, until now developed independently, and xe2x80x93 as a consequence xe2x80x93 at promoting the cooperation between the communities of Speech, Text and Multimodality. In the following we briefly highlight the main issues tackled by ENABLER on the different layers. 2. The Main Issues 2.1.

W98-1503,Aligning Clattses in Parallel Texts,1998,13,9,2,1,54499,sotiris boutsis,Proceedings of the Third Conference on Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing,0,"This paper describes a method for the automatic alignment of parallel texts at clause level. The method features statistical techniques coupled with shallow linguistic processing. It presupposes a parallel bilingual corpus and identifies alignments between the clauses of the source and target language sides of the corpus. Parallel texts are first statistically aligned at sentence level and then tagged with their part-of-speech categories. Regular grammars functioning on tags, recognize clauses on both sides of the parallel text. A probabilistic model is applied next, operating on the basis of word occurrence and co-occurrence probabilities and character lengths. Depending on sentence size, possible alignments arc fed into a dynamic progranuning framework or a simulated annealing system in order to find or approxim~te the best alignment. 1he method has been tested on a Small Eng~ lish-Greek corpus consisting of texts relevant to software systems and has produced promising results in terms of correctly identified clause alignments."
P94-1051,Automatic Alignment in Parallel Corpora,1994,6,23,3,0,38940,harris papageorgiou,32nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"This paper addresses the alignment issue in the framework of exploitation of large bimultilingual corpora for translation purposes. A generic alignment scheme is proposed that can meet varying requirements of different applications. Depending on the level at which alignment is sought, appropriate surface linguistic information is invoked coupled with information about possible unit delimiters. Each text unit (sentence, clause or phrase) is represented by the sum of its content tags. The results are then fed into a dynamic programming framework that computes the optimum alignment of units. The proposed scheme has been tested at sentence level on parallel corpora of the CELEX database. The success rate exceeded 99%. The next steps of the work concern the testing of the scheme's efficiency at lower levels endowed with necessary bilingual information about potential delimiters."
