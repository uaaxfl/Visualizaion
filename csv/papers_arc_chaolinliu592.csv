Large-scale comparisons between the poetry of Tang and Song dynasties shed light on how words and expressions were used and shared among the poets. That some words were used only in the Tang poetry and some only in the Song poetry could lead to interesting research in linguistics. That the most frequent colors are different in the Tang and Song poetry provides a trace of the changing social circumstances in the dynasties. Results of the current work link to research topics of lexicography, semantics, and social transitions. We discuss our findings and present our algorithms for efficient comparisons among the poems, which are crucial for completing billion times of comparisons within acceptable time."

We look into CTP with computational tools from specific linguistic perspectives, including distributional semantics and collocational analysis. From such quantitative viewpoints, we compare the usage of wind and moon in the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu. Colors in poems function like sounds in movies, and play a crucial role in the imageries of poems. Thus, words for colors are studied, and white is the main focus because it is the most frequent color in CTP. We also explore some cases of using colored words in antithesis pairs that were central for fostering the imageries of the poems. CTP also contains useful historical information, and we extract person names in CTP to study the social networks of the Tang poets. Such information can then be integrated with the China Biographical Database of Harvard University."

Information offered by CBDB is instrumental for human historians, and serves as a core foundation for automatic tagging systems, like MARKUS of the Leiden University. Mining texts in Difangzhi is not easy partially because there is litter knowledge about the grammars of literary Chinese so far. We employed techniques of language modeling and conditional random fields to find person and location names and their relationships. The methods were evaluated with realistic Difangzhi data of more than 2 million Chinese characters written in literary Chinese. Experimental results indicate that useful information was discovered from the current dataset."

A co-attachment structure denotes the lack of [movement] feature in both the verb and noun surrounding a PP. This proposal is arrived when we annotate the semantic feature [-movement] to both VP and NP1, respectively, in a caused-motion construction of V NP1 into NP2 (e.g., vote an individual into the presidency; shamed us into pity; define ourselves into a box)."

Our system automatically generates templates with the help of a dictionary and confusion sets. The templates can be used to detect and correct errors in essays.

Without a proper estimation of students' competency in using vocabulary, it will be hard for a computer-assisted language learning system to provide course material tailored to each individual student's needs. Computer-assisted item generation allows the creation of large-scale item pools and further supports Web-based learning and assessment. With the abundant text resources available on the Web, one can create cloze items that cover a wide range of topics, thereby achieving usability, diversity and security of the item pool. One can apply keyword-based techniques like concordancing that extract sentences from the Web, and retain those sentences that contain the desired keyword to produce cloze items. However, such techniques fail to consider the fact that many words in natural languages are polysemous so that the recommended sentences typically include a non-negligible number of irrelevant sentences. In addition, a substantial amount of labor is required to look for those sentences in which the word to be tested really carries the sense of interest. We propose a novel word sense disambiguation-based method for locating sentences in which designated words carry specific senses, and apply generalized collocation-based methods to select distractors that are needed for multiple-choice cloze items. Experimental results indicated that our system was able to produce a usable cloze item for every 1.6 items it returned."
