An essential characteristics which makes it basically different from EuroWordNet (where the main structuring semantic relations are synon- 361- ymy and hyponymy) - is its ability to capture the various dimensions of word meaning which are equally important in language and therefore in the development of a computational lexicon. The basic vocabulary relies on an extension of ""qualia structure"" for structuring the semantic/conceptual types, which is understood as a representational tool for expressing the componential multidimensional aspect of word meaning (Pustejovsky 1991, 1995; Calzolari 1991). The perspective adopted is that all words have internal structure, based on different semantic types, and differ in terms of complexity, which affects the way they compose in a sentence. The so-called ""extended qualia structure"" of SIMPLE addresses the concern of capturing more or less subtle linguistic differences while maintaining a systematic and consistent structuring of the lexical representations. This is achieved by specifying, for each qualia role, its extended qualia set, namely subtypes of that role which are consistent with its interpretation. To the standard approach of defining"

The Council of Europe, which had co-sponsored the workshop, formed a group of experts, representing European institutes with a well established tradition in the field of lexical and corpus studies, to explore the feasibility of harmonising their activities, in order to establish a Network of European Reference Corpora (NERC, for which see Calzolari, Baker, Kruyt 1996; Zampolli 1996). This group, gradually enlarged to include members of all the European Union (EU) languages, constituted the PAROLE Consortium which has executed the LE (Language Engineering) PAROLE project now followed by the LE SIMPLE project carried on by a similar Consortium1. 2 Goals of PAROLE and SIMPLE 2 . 1 PAROLE: Corpora and Morphological and Syntactic Lexicons The central goal of LE PAROLE was to produce in Europe an initial core of harmonised corpora and lexicons.

Introduction The availability of Language Resources (LRs) - such as corpora, computational lexicons and parsers - is crucial to most NLP technologies. Recent initiatives have monitored the availability of Language Resources for different languages, and highlighted a digital divide between English and other languages (Soria et al., 2012), (Rehm and Uszkoreit, 2012). While the economic potential of English ensures that English LRs are developed and maintained not only in the academic sector but also by commercial players, the involvement of research communities for other languages is much more crucial to ensure that the necessary instruments (both data and tools) are made available for natural language processing purposes. At the same time, production of quality LRs is only the first step; in order to be usable, LRs must also be documented and made available to the community in such a way that they are easy to find and to use."

The START user interface gathers the information on the used/cited resources and connects them to the paper and its authors. A communication protocol settled between ILC and START is responsible for feeding and updating the database with the information gathered with the user interface. Since its first appearance in the LREC 2010 conference (Calzolari et al., 2010), the LRE Map underwent many changes in its internal structure to address specific requirements of the referenced community. For example, the number of slots dedicated to the languages changed from 3 to 6 after the pioneering work on language matrices (Mariani and Francopoulo, 2012), and some additional details such as size and unit of the described language resource have been added to keep track of the amount of information a LR can provide to the community. All these changes caused variations in the record tracks and, consequently, in the database structure. Moreover, the LREC 2016 database"

Comparison between LREC and COLING: some interesting differences It is interesting to see which are the major features that characterise different conferences with respect to Language Resources. The Map helps us in this, in particular to look at the differences between LREC and COLING for which we collected information for the last 4 editions of both conferences (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016). There is a clear difference with respect to LR Modality, as reflected in Figure 1: LREC has more participation of the Speech and Multimodal communities and therefore more Speech and Multimodal LRs. A typical feature of LREC is that the Sign Language community is well represented (and consequently the corresponding type of LRs), while these are completely absent from COLING. Figure 3 shows the comparison of LR Usages: the three most frequent Usages are exactly the same, in the same order, with similar frequency.

There is a long history of creating a standard for western language resources.

The naive approach of simply taking the most frequent words in a language is flawed in many ways. First, all frequency counts are corpus-based and hence inherit the bias of corpus sampling. For instance, since it is easier to sample written formal texts, words used predominantly in informal contexts are usually underrepresented. Second, frequency of content words is topic-dependent and may vary from corpus to corpus.

Within each of the MLM layers, different types of lexical object are distinguished : fits with as many Asian languages as possible, and contributing to the ISO-TC37/SC4 activities. As a starting point, we employ an existing description framework, the MILE framework (Bertagna et al., 2004a), to describe several lexical entries of several Asian languages. Through building sample lexicons (research item (2)), we will find problems of the existing framework, and extend it so as to fit with Asian languages. In this extension, we need to be careful in keeping consistency with the existing framework.

To give a concrete example, almost all theoretical frameworks claim that lexical items have a complex semantic organization, but some of them try to describe it through a multidimensional internal structure (cf. the qualia structure in the Generative Lexicon, Pustejovsky 1995), others by specifying a network of semantic relations (cf. WordNet, Miller et al. 1990), and others in terms of argumental frames (cf FrameNet, Baker et al. 1998; Lexical Conceptual Structures, Jackendoff 1992; etc.). A way out of this theoretical variation is to augment the expressive power of the lexical representation language both horizontally, i.e. by distributing the linguistic information over mutually independent ""coding layers"", and vertically, by further specifying the information conveyed by each such layer. This solution will contribute to solve the issues raised by theoretical variation by defining a common level onto which different types of resources will be mapped without loss of information.

In its general design, also MILE is envisaged as a highly modular and layered architecture as described in Calzolari et al. (2001). Modularity concerns the “horizontal” MILE organization, in which independent and yet linked modules target different dimensions of lexical entries. On the other hand, at the “vertical” level, a layered organization is necessary to allow for different degrees of granularity of lexical descriptions, so that both “shallow” and “deep” representations of lexical items can be captured. This feature is particularly crucial in order to stay open to the different styles and approaches to the lexicon adopted by existing multilingual systems.

Lastly, the vast range of diversity of languages also makes it impossible to have one single universal centralized resource, or even a centralized repository of resources. Although the paradigm of distributed and interoperable lexical resources has largely been discussed and invoked, very little has been made in comparison for the development of new methods and techniques for its practical realization. Some initial steps are made to design frameworks enabling inter-lexica access, search, integration and operability. An example is the Lexus tool (Kemps-Snijders et al., 2006), based on the Lexical Markup Framework (Romary et al., 2006), that goes in the direction of managing the exchange of data among large-scale lexical resources. A similar tool, but more tailored to the collaborative creation of lexicons for endangered language, is SHAWEL (Gulrajani and Harrison, 2002). However, the general impression is that little has been made towards the development of new methods and techniques for attaining a concrete interoperability among lexical resources.

In cases where workflows need to be built chaining together tools not originally built to work in pipeline/together, standards will ensure their execution. As of today, in most cases workflows can be run with tools that were already designed to work together, or with the use of format converters. This is a major obstacle esp. in the context of web-based platforms for distributed language services. Experiences such as PANACEA (Bel 2010, Toral et al. 2011) show that using a common standardised format facilitates integration. If tools were built/modified to work directly on common/standard formats, workflows might be simpler, easier to design and quicker to run.

The interoperability effort should not be seen as a superimposition of standards but rather as the promotion of a series of best practices that might help other contributors to better access and easily reuse the annotation layers provided. In this sense encouraging the use of a representation format such as GrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007) in a second stage might be helpful. On the one hand the stand-off approach of keeping each layer of annotation separated from the others and from the raw data seems particularly suitable for the Library; on the other hand GrAF enables a soft approach to interoperability, in that it can be used to uniformly represent formats that are both syntactically and semantically different and this could make it easier for the contributors to recognize compatible layers without forcing the adoption of a rigid standard.
