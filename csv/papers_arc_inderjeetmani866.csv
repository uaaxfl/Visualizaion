P12-4001,Qualitative Modeling of Spatial Prepositions and Motion Expressions,2012,0,0,1,1,42626,inderjeet mani,Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Tutorial Abstracts,0,"The ability to understand spatial prepositions and motion in natural language will enable a variety of new applications involving systems that can respond to verbal directions, map travel guides, display incident reports, etc., providing for enhanced information extraction, question-answering, information retrieval, and more principled text to scene rendering. Until now, however, the semantics of spatial relations and motion verbs has been highly problematic. This tutorial presents a new approach to the semantics of spatial descriptions and motion expressions based on linguistically interpreted qualitative reasoning. Our approach allows for formal inference from spatial descriptions in natural language, while leveraging annotation schemes for time, space, and motion, along with machine learning from annotated corpora. We introduce a compositional semantics for motion expressions that integrates spatial primitives drawn from qualitative calculi."

W08-1402,Learning to Match Names Across Languages,2008,31,4,1,1,42626,inderjeet mani,Coling 2008: Proceedings of the workshop Multi-source Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization,0,"We report on research on matching names in different scripts across languages. We explore two trainable approaches based on comparing pronunciations. The first, a cross-lingual approach, uses an automatic name-matching program that exploits rules based on phonological comparisons of the two languages carried out by humans. The second, monolingual approach, relies only on automatic comparison of the phonological representations of each pair. Alignments produced by each approach are fed to a machine learning algorithm. Results show that the monolingual approach results in machine-learning based comparison of person-names in English and Chinese at an accuracy of over 97.0 F-measure."

It covers both named and nominal references to places, grounding them where possible with geo-coordinates, including both relative and absolute locations, and characterizes relationships among places in terms of a region calculus. A freely available annotation editor has been developed for SpatialML, along with a corpus of annotated documents released by the Linguistic Data Consortium. Inter-annotator agreement on SpatialML is 77.0 F-measure for extents on that corpus. An automatic tagger for SpatialML extents scores 78.5 F-measure. A disambiguator scores 93.0 F-measure and 93.4 Predictive Accuracy. In adapting the extent tagger to new domains, merging the training data from the above corpus with annotated data in the new domain provides the best performance."

These qualitative relations can be usefully supplemented with information about metric constraints, specifically as to how long events last.

The work is carried out in the context of the TimeML framework for marking up events and their temporal relations. This pilot study examines the feasibility of acquisition of metric temporal constraints from corpora."

To address data sparseness, we used temporal reasoning as an over-sampling method to dramatically expand the amount of training data, resulting in predictive accuracy on link labeling as high as 93% using a Maximum Entropy classifier on human annotated data. This method compared favorably against a series of increasingly sophisticated baselines involving expansion of rules derived from human intuitions."

To establish the difficulty of the problem, we measured the degree of ambiguity, with respect to a gazetteer, for toponyms in news. We found that 67.82% of the toponyms found in a corpus that were ambiguous in a gazetteer lacked a local discriminator in the text. Given the scarcity of human-annotated data, our method used unsupervised machine learning to develop disambiguation rules. Toponyms were automatically tagged with information about them found in a gazetteer. A toponym that was ambiguous in the gazetteer was automatically disambiguated based on preference heuristics. This automatically tagged data was used to train a machine learner, which disambiguated toponyms in a human-annotated news corpus at 78.5% accuracy."

Ontologies can play a critical role in such cataloguing. In this paper, we describe a system that automatically induces an ontology from any large on-line text collection in a specific domain. The ontology that is induced consists of domain concepts, related by kind-of and part-of links. To achieve domain-independence, we use a combination of relatively shallow methods along with any available repositories of applicable background knowledge. We describe our evaluation experiences using these methods, and provide examples of induced structures."

This paper proposes a new representation for the temporal structure of narratives. The representation is parsimonious, using temporal relations as surrogates for discourse relations.

Annotation examples and challenges are discussed, along with a report on progress to date in creating annotated corpora."

In appreciation of this need, there has recently been a renewed interest in temporal and event-based reasoning for NLP, aimed at addressing challenges in areas such as information extraction, question-answering, and summarization.This tutorial will begin with an overview of theoretical work on tense, aspect, and event structure in natural language, as well as the fundamentals of temporal reasoning. It will then go on to discuss the annotation of temporal and event expressions in corpora, including the TimeML specification language and other results from the ARDA/NRRC Workshop on Temporal and Event Recognition for Question Answering Systems (TERQAS). The tutorial will examine how to formally distinguish events and their temporal anchoring in documents, and will discuss algorithms for ordering events mentioned in a document relative to each other and for computing closure over an entire discourse of events.Tutorial attendees can expect to learn about current methodologies and computational resources, the outstanding problems in the area, as well as obtain follow-up pointers to the research literature. Attendees should be familiar with information extraction and the notion of corpus annotation. The course should appeal to those with an interest in leveraging robust semantic analysis for tasks like question-answering, information extraction, and summarization."

The goal of our research was to find an automatically calculated measure that correlates well with human judges' assessment of answer correctness in the context of question answering tasks.

We determined that the answer correctness predicted by Qaviar agreed with the human 93% to 95% of the time. 41 question-answering systems were ranked by both Qaviar and human assessors, and these rankings correlated with a Kendall's Tau measure of 0.920, compared to a correlation of 0.956 between human assessors on the same data."
