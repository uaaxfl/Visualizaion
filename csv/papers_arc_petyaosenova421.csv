In this paper, we describe our efforts in manually aligning monolingual dictionaries. The alignment is carried out at sense-level for various resources in 15 languages. Moreover, senses are annotated with possible semantic relationships such as broadness, narrowness, relatedness, and equivalence. In comparison to previous datasets for this task, this dataset covers a wide range of languages and resources and focuses on the more challenging task of linking general-purpose language. We believe that our data will pave the way for further advances in alignment and evaluation of word senses by creating new solutions, particularly those notoriously requiring data such as neural networks.

They reflect several separate but connected strategies: manipulating the shape and the content of the knowledge base, assigning weights over the relations in the knowledge base, and the addition of new relations to it. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that the previously proposed knowledge bases organize linguistic and world knowledge suboptimally for the task of word sense disambiguation. In doing so, the paper also establishes a new state of the art for knowledge-based approaches. Its best models are competitive in the broader context of supervised systems as well."

While previous work has focused on learning from raw word input, using word and character embeddings only, we show that for morphologically rich languages, such as Bulgarian, access to POS information contributes more to the performance gains than the detailed morphological information. Thus, we show that named entity recognition needs only coarse-grained POS tags, but at the same time it can benefit from simultaneously using some POS information of different granularity. Our evaluation results over a standard dataset show sizeable improvements over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian NER."

The results indicate that there is considerable variation in treatments across treebanks and thereby also, to some extent, across languages and across theoretical frameworks. The comparison is focused on the annotation of light verb constructions and verbal idioms. The survey shows that the light verb constructions either get special annotations as such, or are treated as ordinary verbs, while VP idioms are handled through different strategies. Based on insights from our investigation, we propose some general guidelines for annotating multiword expressions in treebanks. The recommendations address the following application-based needs: distinguishing MWEs from similar but compositional constructions; searching distinct types of MWEs in treebanks; awareness of literal and nonliteral meanings; and normalization of the MWE representation. The cross-lingually and cross-theoretically focused survey is intended as an aid to accessing treebanks and an aid for further work on treebank annotation."

The challenge is to enhance relations among concepts instead of text entities, the latter pursued in most works. Our ultimate goal is to exploit these additional chains for concept disambiguation as well as sparseness resolution at concept level. First, a gold standard was prepared with manually connected links among concepts, anaphoric pronouns and contextual equivalents. This step was necessary not only for test purposes, but also for better orientation in the co-referent types and distribution. Then, two automatic systems were tested on the gold standard. Note that these systems were not designed specially for concept chaining. The conclusion is that the state-of-the-art co-reference resolution systems might address the concept sparseness problem, but not so much the concept disambiguation task. For the latter, word-sense disambiguation systems have to be integrated."

The underlying idea behind the ontology-based lexicon is its organization via two semantic relations - equivalence and subsumption. These relations reflect the distribution of lexical unit senses with respect to the concepts in the ontology. The lexical unit candidates for concept mapping have been selected from two large and well-developed lexical resources for Bulgarian - a machine readable explanatory dictionary and a morphological lexicon. In the initial step, the lexical units were handled that have equivalent senses to the concepts in the ontology (2500 at the moment). Then, in the second stage, we are proceeding with lexical units selected on their frequency distribution in a large Bulgarian corpus. This step is the more challenging one, since it might require also additions of concepts to the ontology.

R09-1022,Feature-Rich Named Entity Recognition for {B}ulgarian Using Conditional Random Fields,2009,25,14,4,0.795455,37368,georgi georgiev,Proceedings of the International Conference {RANLP}-2009,0,"The paper presents a feature-rich approach to the automatic recognition and categorization of named entities (persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous) in news text for Bulgarian. We combine well-established features used for other languages with language-specific lexical, syntactic and morphological information. In particular, we make use of the rich tagset annotation of the BulTreeBank (680 morpho-syntactic tags), from which we derive suitable task-specific tagsets (local and nonlocal). We further add domain-specific gazetteers and additional unlabeled data, achieving F1=89.4%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art results for English."
osenova-etal-2008-language,Language Resources for Semantic Document Annotation and Crosslingual Retrieval,2008,-1,-1,1,1,12058,petya osenova,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'08),0,"This paper describes the interaction among language resources for an adequate concept annotation of domain texts in several languages. The architecture includes domain ontology, domain texts, language specific lexicons, regular grammars and disambiguation rules. Ontology plays a central role in the architecture. We assume that it represents the meaning of the terms in the lexicons. Thus, the lexicons for the languages of the project (http://www.lt4el.eu/ - the LT4eL (Language Technology for eLearning) project is supported by the European Community under the Information Society and Media Directorate, Learning and Cultural Heritage Unit.) are constructed on the base of the ontology. The grammars and disambiguation rules facilitate the annotation of the text with concepts from the ontology. The established in this way relation between ontology and text supports different searches for content in the annotated documents. This is considered the preparatory phase for the integration of a semantic search facility in Learning Management Systems. The implementation and performance of this search are discussed in the context of related work as well as other types of searches. Also the results from some preliminary steps towards evaluation of the concept-based and text-based search are presented."
W07-1706,Towards the Automatic Extraction of Definitions in {S}lavic,2007,16,31,5,0,7047,adam przepiorkowski,Proceedings of the Workshop on {B}alto-{S}lavonic Natural Language Processing,0,"This paper presents the results of the preliminary experiments in the automatic extraction of definitions (for semi-automatic glossary construction) from usually unstructured or only weakly structured e-learning texts in Bulgarian, Czech and Polish. The extraction is performed by regular grammars over XML-encoded morphosyntactically-annotated documents. The results are less than satisfying and we claim that the reason for that is the intrinsic difficulty of the task, as measured by the low interannotator agreement, which calls for more sophisticated deeper linguistic processing, as well as for the use of machine learning classification techniques."
simov-osenova-2006-shallow,Shallow Semantic Annotation of {B}ulgarian,2006,9,0,2,0.240836,14367,kiril simov,Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}{'}06),0,"The paper discusses shallow semantic annotation of Bulgarian treebank. Our goal is to construct the next layer of linguistic interpretation over the morphological and syntactic layers that have already been encoded in the treebank. The annotation is called shallow because it encodes only the senses for the non-functional words and the relations between the semantic indices connected to them. We do not encode quantifiers and scope information. An ontology is employed as a stock of the concepts and relations that form the word senses. Our lexicon is based on the Generative Lexicon (GL) model (Pustejovsky 1995) as it was implemented in the SIMPLE project (Lenci et. al. 2000). GL defines the way in which the words are connected to the concepts and the relations in the ontology. Also it provides mechanisms for literal sense changes like type-coercion, metonymy, and similar. Some of these phenomena are presented in the annotation."

Over the years, the competition has registered a steady increment in the number of participants and languages involved. In fact, from the original eight groups which participated in 2003 QA track, the number of competitors in 2005 rose to twenty-four. Also, the performances of the systems have steadily improved, and the average of the best performances in the 2005 saw an increase of 10{\%} with respect to the previous year."

We focus on the treebanking task as a trigger for basic language resources compilation. Two strategies have been applied in this respect: (1) implementing the main pre-processing modules before the treebank compilation and (2) creating more elaborate types of resources in parallel to the treebank compilation. The description of language resources within BulTreeBank project is divided into two parts: language technology, which includes tokenization, morphosyntactic analyzer, morphosyntactic disambiguation, partial grammars, and language data, which includes the layers of the BulTreeBank corpus and the variety of lexicons. The advantages of our approach to a less-spoken language (like Bulgarian) are as follows: it triggers the creation of the basic set of language resources which lack for certain languages and it rises the question about the ways of language resources creation."

Its base are two newspaper subcorpora from larger reference corpora of Bulgarian and Croatian. In the beginning we rely on more extralinguistically-oriented, but methodologically cleaner parameters of similarity like: specific topics, pre-defined time span and data size. The idea of xe2x80x98 lightxe2x80x99 and xe2x80x98 hardxe2x80x99 comparable corpora is introduced. At this stage we aim at producing a xe2x80x98 lightxe2x80x99 bilingual comparable corpus. The algorithm for identifying lexical similarity and aligning linguistic units is presented, and the initial experiments are outlined."
simov-osenova-2004-hybrid,A Hybrid Strategy For Regular Grammar Parsing,2004,5,4,2,0,14367,kiril simov,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}{'}04),0,"The paper outlines a hybrid architecture for a partial parser based on regular grammars over XML documents. The parser is used to support the annotation process in the BulTreeBank project. Thus the parser annotates only the xe2x80x98surexe2x80x99 cases. To maximize the number of the analyzed phrases the parser applies a set of grammars in a dynamic fashion. Each grammar determines not only the constituent structure (plus some syntactic dependencies internal to the structure), but also a description of the local and global context of the recognized phrase. The grammars available to the parser are arranged in a network. The order of the grammars application depends on the initial ordering in the network and the descriptions associated with the grammars. Thus the traverse is not deterministic. Additionally, the application of the grammars can be interleaved with the applications of other XML tools like remove, insert and transform operations. This architecture provides a flexible means for guiding the linguistic analysis in order to utilize all the available linguistic knowledge and to produce a very accurate partial analysis."

It differs from other grammar-based annotation schemes in having a hybrid status with respect to the partial parsing component and the full parsing module. As the parsing complexity is handled preferably by the pre-processing step, the task of the HPSG module is maximally facilitated and simplified."
