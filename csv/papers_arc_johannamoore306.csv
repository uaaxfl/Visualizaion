However, what the sentiment score actually represents has often been overlooked. As a measurement of opinions and affective states, a sentiment score generally consists of two aspects: polarity and intensity. We decompose sentiment scores into these two aspects and study how they are conveyed through individual modalities and combined multimodal models in a naturalistic monologue setting. In particular, we build unimodal and multimodal multi-task learning models with sentiment score prediction as the main task and polarity and/or intensity classification as the auxiliary tasks. Our experiments show that sentiment analysis benefits from multi-task learning, and individual modalities differ when conveying the polarity and intensity aspects of sentiment."

Previous analyses of the MATCH corpus show that older users have significantly longer dialogues than younger users and that they are less satisfied with the system. Open questions remain regarding the relationship between information recall and cognitive abilities. This study documents a length annotation scheme designed to explore causes of additional length in the dialogues and the relationships between length, cognitive abilities, user satisfaction, and information recall. Results show that primary causes of older usersÂ additional length include using polite vocabulary, providing additional information relevant to the task, and using full sentences to respond to the system. Regression models were built to predict length from cognitive abilities and user satisfaction from length. Overall, users with higher cognitive ability scores had shorter dialogues than users with lower cognitive ability scores, and users with shorter dialogues were more satisfied with the system than users with longer dialogues. Dialogue length and cognitive abilities were significantly correlated with information recall. Overall, older users tended to use a human-to-human communication style with the system, whereas younger users tended to adopt a factual interaction style."

We show that standard intrinsic metrics such as F-score alone do not predict the outcomes well. However, we can build predictive performance functions that account for up to 50% of the variance in learning gain by combining features based on standard evaluation scores and on the confusion matrix entries. We argue that building such predictive models can help us better evaluate performance of NLP components that cannot be distinguished based on F-score alone, and illustrate our approach by comparing the current interpretation component in the system to a new classifier trained on the evaluation data."

J11-3003,A Strategy for Information Presentation in Spoken Dialog Systems,2011,45,16,3,0.625,5404,vera demberg,Computational Linguistics,0,"In spoken dialog systems, information must be presented sequentially, making it difficult to quickly browse through a large number of options. Recent studies have shown that user satisfaction is negatively correlated with dialog duration, suggesting that systems should be designed to maximize the efficiency of the interactions. Analysis of the logs of 2,000 dialogs between users and nine different dialog systems reveals that a large percentage of the time is spent on the information presentation phase, thus there is potentially a large pay-off to be gained from optimizing information presentation in spoken dialog systems.n n This article proposes a method that improves the efficiency of coping with large numbers of diverse options by selecting options and then structuring them based on a model of the user's preferences. This enables the dialog system to automatically determine trade-offs between alternative options that are relevant to the user and present these trade-offs explicitly. Multiple attractive options are thereby structured such that the user can gradually refine her request to find the optimal trade-off.n n To evaluate and challenge our approach, we conducted a series of experiments that test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results show that basing the content structuring and content selection process on a user model increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the user's interaction. Users complete their tasks more successfully and more quickly. Furthermore, user surveys revealed that participants found that the user-model based system presents complex trade-offs understandably and increases overall user satisfaction. The experiments also indicate that presenting users with a brief overview of options that do not fit their requirements significantly improves the user's overview of available options, also making them feel more confident in having been presented with all relevant options."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where dialogue strategies are learned and evaluated with both simulated younger users and simulated older users. The simulated users were derived from a corpus of interactions with a strict system-initiative spoken dialogue system (SDS). Learning from simulated younger users leads to a policy which is close to one of the dialogue strategies of the underlying SDS, while the simulated older users allow us to learn more flexible dialogue strategies that accommodate mixed initiative. We conclude that simulated users are a useful technique for modelling the behaviour of new user groups."

In this paper, we present a method for annotating verbal reference to people in conversational speech, with a focus on reference to conversation participants. Our goal is to provide a resource that tackles the issues of vagueness, ambiguity, and contextual dependency in a nuanced yet reliable way, with the ultimate aim of supporting work on summarization and information extraction for conversation."

This article describes a multi-level approach to presenting user-tailored information in spoken dialogues which brings together for the first time multi-attribute decision models, strategic content planning, surface realization that incorporates prosody prediction, and unit selection synthesis that takes the resulting prosodic structure into account. The system selects the most important options to mention and the attributes that are most relevant to choosing between them, based on the user model. Multiple options are selected when each offers a compelling trade-off. To convey these trade-offs, the system employs a novel presentation strategy which straightforwardly lends itself to the determination of information structure, as well as the contents of referring expressions. During surface realization, the prosodic structure is derived from the information structure using Combinatory Categorial Grammar in a way that allows phrase boundaries to be determined in a flexible, data-driven fashion. This approach to choosing pitch accents and edge tones is shown to yield prosodic structures with significantly higher acceptability than baseline prosody prediction models in an expert evaluation. These prosodic structures are then shown to enable perceptibly more natural synthesis using a unit selection voice that aims to produce the target tunes, in comparison to two baseline synthetic voices. An expert evaluation and f0 analysis confirm the superiority of the generator-driven intonation and its contribution to listeners' ratings."

Because the subject matter is richer, the range of vocabulary and grammatical structures is larger meaning NLU tools are more likely to encounter out-of-vocabulary words or extra-grammatical utterances. This is especially true in medical advising and tutoring where users may not know the correct vocabulary and use common sense terms or descriptions instead. Techniques designed to improve robustness (e.g., skipping unknown words, relaxing grammatical constraints, mapping unknown words to known words) are effective at increasing the number of utterances for which an NLU sub-system can produce a semantic interpretation. However, such techniques introduce additional ambiguity and can lead to a loss of fidelity (i.e., a mismatch between the semantic interpretation and what the language producer meant). To control this trade-off, we propose semantic interpretation confidence scores akin to speech recognition confidence scores and describe our initial attempt to compute such a score in a modularized NLU sub-system."

Surprisingly, students had initiative more of the time in the didactic dialogues (21% of the turns) than in the Socratic dialogues (10% of the turns), and there was no direct relationship between student initiative and learning.

In this paper, we describe a Wizard of Oz tool and a study which applies user models based on multi-attribute decision theory to the problem of generating tailored and concise system responses for a spoken dialogue system. The resulting Wizard corpus will be distributed by the LDC as part of our work on the ISLE project."

The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics presentations about complex, quantitative information. The language is designed to satisfy four requirements: to represent information about complex quantitative relations and aggregate properties; compositionality; to represent certain pragmatic distinctions needed for satisfying communicative goals; and to be usable as input by the media-specific generators in our system."

However, novel graphical presentations that represent many attributes and relationships are often difficult to understand completely until explained. Automatically generated graphical presentations must therefore either be limited to generating simple, conventionalized graphical presentations, or risk incomprehensibility. A possible solution to this problem would be to extend automatic graphical presentation systems to generate explanatory captions in natural language, to enable users to understand the information expressed in the graphic. This paper presents a system to do so. It uses a text planner to determine the content and structure of the captions based on: (1) a representation of the structure of the graphical presentation and its mapping to the data it depicts, (2) a framework for identifying the perceptual complexity of graphical elements, and (3) the structure of the data expressed in the graphic. The output of the planner is further processed regarding issues such as ordering, aggregation, centering, generating referring expressions, and lexical choice. We discuss the architecture of our system and its strengths and limitations. Our implementation is currently limited to 2-D charts and maps, but, except for lexical information, it is completely domain independent. We illustrate our discussion with figures and generated captions about housing sales in Pittsburgh."

We apply a machine learning program, C4.5, to induce decision trees for cue occurrence and placement from a corpus of data coded for a variety of features previously thought to affect cue usage. Our experiments enable us to identify the features with most predictive power, and show that machine learning can be used to induce decision trees useful for text generation."
J97-1001,Empirical Studies in Discourse,1997,80,27,2,0,6000,marilyn walker,Computational Linguistics,0,"Computational theories of discourse are concerned with the context-based interpretation or generation of discourse phenomena in text and dialogue. In the past, research in this area focused on specifying the mechanisms underlying particular discourse phenomena; the models proposed were often motivated by a few constructed examples. While this approach led to many theoretical advances, models developed in this manner are difficult to evaluate because it is hard to tell whether they generalize beyond the particular examples used to motivate them. Recently however the field has turned to issues of robustness and the coverage of theories of particular phenomena with respect to specific types of data. This new empirical focus is supported by several recent advances: an increasing theoretical consensus on discourse models; a large amount of online dialogue and textual corpora available; and improvements in component technologies and tools for building and testing discourse and dialogue testbeds. This means that it is now possible to determine how representative particular discourse phenomena are, how frequently they occur, whether they are related to other phenomena, what percentage of the cases a particular model covers, the inherent difficulty of the problem, and how well an algorithm for processing or generating the phenomena should perform to be considered a good model. This issue brings together a collection of papers illustrating recent approaches to empirical research in discourse generation and interpretation. Section 2 gives a general overview of empirical studies in discourse and describes an empirical research strategy that leads from empirical findings to general theories. Section 3 discusses how each article exemplifies the empirical research strategy and how empirical methods have been employed in each research project."

We currently neglect this possibility. down to the basement is a substep in the plan that achieves bring S the ironing board. In these examples, the referring expression in the NP is not sufficient to uniquely identify the intended referent, but it is its linguistic context that adds other necessary constraints. This is the reason why we call these referring expressions distributed. To our knowledge, while many researchers have worked on generating referring expressions, e.g. [Appelt, 1985], [Kronfeld, 1990], [Dale, 1992], [Pattabhiraman and Cercone, 1990], 2 distributed referring expressions have not been addressed yet.

J96-3006,Toward a Synthesis of Two Accounts of Discourse Structure,1996,12,67,2,1,55946,megan moser,Computational Linguistics,0,"Among researchers interested in computational models of discourse, there has been a long-standing debate between proponents of approaches based on domain-independent rhetorical relations, and those who subscribe to approaches based on intentionality. In this paper, we argue that the main theories representing these two approaches, RST (Mann and Thompson 1988) and G&S (Grosz and Sidner 1986), make similar claims about how speakers' intentions determine a structure of their discourse. The similarity occurs because the nucleus-satellite relation among text spans in RST corresponds to the dominance relation among intentions in G&S. Building on this similarity, we sketch a partial mapping between the two theories to show that the main points of the two theories are equivalent. Furthermore, the additional claims found in only RST or only G&S are largely consistent. The issue of what structure is determined by semantic (domain) relations in the discourse and how this structure might be related to the intentional structure is discussed. We suggest the synthesis of the two theories would be useful to researchers in both natural language interpretation and generation."

First, discourse plans must adequately represent the intentional structure of the utterances they produce in order to enable a computational discourse agent to respond effectively to communicative failures [15]. Second, discourse plans must represent the informational structure of utterances. In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should be formally characterisable in terms of soundness and completeness."

Follow-up questions must be interpreted in the context of the ongoing conversation, and the system's previous contributions form part of this context. Furthermore, if a system is to be able to clarify misunderstood explanations or to elaborate on prior explanations, it must understand what it has conveyed in prior explanations. Previous approaches to generating multisentential texts have relied solely on rhetorical structuring techniques. In this paper, we argue that, to handle explanation dialogues successfully, a discourse model must include information about the intended effect of individual parts of the text on the hearer, as well as how the parts relate to one another rhetorically. We present a text planner that records this information and show how the resulting structure is used to respond appropriately to a follow-up question."

In this paper, I describe the strategies we have implemented for identifying relevant prior explanations, and the mechanisms that enable our text planner to exploit the information stored in its discourse history in order to omit information that has previously been communicated, to point out similarities and differences between entities and situations, and to mark re-explanations in circumstances where they are deemed appropriate."
J92-4007,A Problem for {RST}: The Need for Multi-Level Discourse Analysis,1992,14,184,1,1,28333,johanna moore,Computational Linguistics,0,"Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987), argues that in most coherent discourse, consecutive discourse elements are related by a small set of rhetorical relations. Moreover, RST suggests that the information conveyed in a discourse over and above what is conveyed in its component clauses can be derived from the rhetorical relation-based structure of the discourse. A large number of natural language generation systems rely on the rhetorical relations defined in RST to impose structure on multi-sentential text (Hovy 1991; Knott 1991; Moore and Paris 1989; Rosner and Stede 1992). In addition, many descriptive studies of discourse have employed RST (Fox 1987; Linden, Cumming, and Martin 1992; Matthiessen and Thompson 1988). However, recent work by Moore and Paris (1992) noted that RST cannot be used as the sole means of controlling discourse structure in an interactive dialogue system, because RST representations provide insufficient information to support the generation of appropriate responses to follow-up questions. The basic problem is that an RST representation of a discourse does not fully specify the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) of that discourse. Intentional structure is crucial for responding effectively to questions that address a previous utterance: without a record of what an utterance was intended to achieve, it is impossible to elaborate or clarify that utterance. 1 Further consideration has led us to conclude that the difficulty observed by Moore and Paris stems from a more fundamental problem with RST analyses. RST presumes that, in general, there will be a single, preferred rhetorical relation holding between consecutive discourse elements. In fact, as has been noted in other work on discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986), discourse elements are related simultaneously on multiple levels. In this paper, we focus on two levels of analysis. The first involves the relation between the information conveyed in consecutive elements of a coherent discourse. Thus, for example, one utterance may describe an event that can be presumed to be the cause of another event described in the subsequent utterance. This causal relation is at what we will call the informational level. The second level of relation results from the fact that discourses are produced to effect changes in the mental state of the discourse participants. In coherent discourse, a speaker is carrying out a consistent plan to achieve the intended changes, and consecutive discourse elements are related to one another by means of the ways in which they participate in that plan. Thus, one utterance may be intended to increase the likelihood that the hearer will come to"
