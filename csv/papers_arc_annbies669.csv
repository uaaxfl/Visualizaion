2020.lrec-1.493,Morphological Segmentation for Low Resource Languages,2020,-1,-1,2,1,17655,justin mott,Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,0,"This paper describes a new morphology resource created by Linguistic Data Consortium and the University of Pennsylvania for the DARPA LORELEI Program. The data consists of approximately 2000 tokens annotated for morphological segmentation in each of 9 low resource languages, along with root information for 7 of the languages. The languages annotated show a broad diversity of typological features. A minimal annotation scheme for segmentation was developed such that it could capture the patterns of a wide range of languages and also be performed reliably by non-linguist annotators. The basic annotation guidelines were designed to be language-independent, but included language-specific morphological paradigms and other specifications. The resulting annotated corpus is designed to support and stimulate the development of unsupervised morphological segmenters and analyzers by providing a gold standard for their evaluation on a more typologically diverse set of languages than has previously been available. By providing root annotation, this corpus is also a step toward supporting research in identifying richer morphological structures than simple morpheme boundaries."

As a part of this program, the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) developed valuable linguistic resources in support of the training and evaluation of such new technologies. This paper focuses on methodologies, infrastructure, and procedure for developing linguistic annotation at various language levels, including Treebank (TB), word alignment (WA), PropBank (PB), and co-reference (CoRef). Inspired by the OntoNotes approach with adaptations to the tasks to reflect the goals and scope of the BOLT project, this effort has introduced more annotation types of informal and free-style genres in English, Chinese and Egyptian Arabic.

Since the output of morphological analyzers is a significant aid to morphological annotation, we developed a morphological analyzer for each language in order to support the annotation task, and also as a deliverable by itself. Our framework for analyzer creation results in tables similar to those used in the successful SAMA analyzer for Arabic, but with a more abstract linguistic level, from which the tables are derived. A lexicon was developed from available resources for integration with the analyzer, and given the speed of development and uncertain coverage of the lexicon, we assumed that the analyzer would necessarily be lacking in some coverage for the project annotation. Our analyzer framework was therefore focused on rapid implementation of the key structures of the language, together with accepting {``}wildcard{''} solutions as possible analyses for a word with an unknown stem, building upon our similar experiences with morphological annotation with Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic."

The language used in social media expresses many differences from other written genres: its vocabulary is informal with intentional deviations from standard orthography such as repeated letters for emphasis; typos and nonstandard abbreviations are common; and nonlinguistic content is written out, such as laughter, sound representations, and emoticons. This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media for two reasons. First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic phonologically, morphologically and lexically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies. Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, SMS messaging and online chat often use a non-standard romanization called Arabizi. In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing state-of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing expect Arabic script input. The corpus described in this paper is expected to support Arabic NLP by providing this resource."

By the very nature of Egyptian Arabic, the data collected is informal, for example Discussion Forum text, which we use for the treebank discussed here. In addition, Egyptian Arabic, like other Arabic dialects, is sufficiently different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that tools and techniques developed for MSA cannot be simply transferred over to work on Egyptian Arabic work. In particular, a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic is needed to mediate between the written text and the segmented, vocalized form used for the syntactic trees. This led to the necessity of a feedback loop between the treebank team and the analyzer team, as improvements in each area were fed to the other. Therefore, by necessity, there needed to be close cooperation between the annotation team and the tool development team, which was to their mutual benefit. Collaboration on this type of challenge, where tools and resources are limited, proved to be remarkably synergistic and opens the way to further fruitful work on Arabic dialects."

In previous machine translation programs, alternate translations of idiomatic expressions had been present in untreebanked data only, but due to the high frequency of such expressions in informal genres such as discussion forums, machine translation system developers requested that alternatives be added to the treebanked data as well. In consultation with machine translation researchers, we chose a pragmatic approach of syntactically annotating only the fluent translation, while retaining the alternate literal translation as a segregated node in the tree. Since the literal translation alternates are often incompatible with English syntax, this approach allows us to create fluent trees without losing information. This resource is expected to support machine translation efforts, and the flexibility provided by the alternate translations is an enhancement to the treebank for this purpose."

Because news broadcasts are predominantly scripted, most of the transcribed speech is in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). As such, the lexical and syntactic structures are very similar to the MSA in written newswire data. However, because this is spoken news, cross-linguistic speech effects such as restarts, fillers, hesitations, and repetitions are common. There is also a certain amount of dialect data present in the BN corpus, from on-the-street interviews and similar informal contexts.

This is particularly the case in a language such as Arabic with morphological and orthographic challenges, and we discuss various aspects of these issues in the context of the Arabic Treebank. The Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA) is closely integrated into the annotation workflow, as the basis for the abstraction between the explicit source text and the more abstract token representation. However, this integration with SAMA gives rise to various problems for the annotation workflow and for maintaining the link between the Treebank and SAMA. In this paper we discuss how we have overcome these problems with consistent and more precise categorization of all of the tokens for their relationship with SAMA. We also discuss how we have improved the creation of several distinct alternative forms of the tokens used in the syntactic trees.

The two annotations were then combined into a single representation. Certain alignment issues between the two types of annotation led to the discovery and correction of annotation errors in each, resulting in a more accurate and useful resource. The development of this corpus was motivated by the need to have both metadata and syntactic structure annotated in order to support synergistic work on speech parsing and structural event detection. Automatic detection of these speech phenomena would simultaneously improve parsing accuracy and provide a mechanism for cleaning up transcriptions for downstream text processing. Similarly, constraints imposed by text processing systems such as parsers can be used to help improve identification of disfluencies and sentence boundaries. This paper reports on our efforts to develop a linguistic resource providing both spoken metadata and syntactic structure information, and describes the resulting corpus of English conversational speech."

Crucial to this approach is the proper characterization of entities as relation components, which allows the integration of the entity annotation with the syntactic structure while retaining the capacity to annotate and extract more complex events. We are training statistical taggers using this annotation for such extraction as well as using them for improving the annotation process."

(b) How did we reconcile the Penn Treebank annotation principles and practices with the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) traditional and more recent grammatical concepts? (c) What are the current issues and nagging problems? (d) What has been achieved and what are our future expectations?"

This paper discusses the implementation of crucial aspects of this new annotation scheme. It incorporates a more consistent treatment of a wide range of grammatical phenomena, provides a set of coindexed null elements in what can be thought of as underlying position for phenomena such as wh-movement, passive, and the subjects of infinitival constructions, provides some non-context free annotational mechanism to allow the structure of discontinuous constituents to be easily recovered, and allows for a clear, concise tagging system for some semantic roles."
