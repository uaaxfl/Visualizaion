However, obtaining labelled data can be both expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the test data that a deployed QE model would be exposed to may differ from its training data in significant ways. In particular, training samples are often labelled by one or a small set of annotators, whose perceptions of translation quality and needs may differ substantially from those of end-users, who will employ predictions in practice. Thus, it is desirable to be able to adapt QE models efficiently to new user data with limited supervision data. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian meta-learning approach for adapting QE models to the needs and preferences of each user with limited supervision. To enhance performance, we further propose an extension to a state-of-the-art Bayesian meta-learning approach which utilizes a matrix-valued kernel for Bayesian meta-learning of quality estimation. Experiments on data with varying number of users and language characteristics demonstrates that the proposed Bayesian meta-learning approach delivers improved predictive performance in both limited and full supervision settings."

We demonstrate this by showing three ways in which user confidence in the outbound translation, as well as its overall final quality, can be affected: backward translation, quality estimation (with alignment) and source paraphrasing. In this paper, we describe an experiment on outbound translation from English to Czech and Estonian. We examine the effects of each proposed feedback module and further focus on how the quality of machine translation systems influence these findings and the user perception of success. We show that backward translation feedback has a mixed effect on the whole process: it increases user confidence in the produced translation, but not the objective quality."

The metric builds on state-of-the-art embedding-based approaches {--} namely BERTScore and Word Mover{'}s Distance {--} by incorporating a notion of sentence semantic similarity. By doing so, it achieves better correlation with human scores on different datasets.

In this scenario, a Quality Estimation (QE) tool can be used to score MT outputs, and a threshold on the QE scores can be applied to decide whether an MT output can be used as-is or requires human post-edition. While this could reduce cost and turnaround times, it could harm translation quality, as QE models are not 100{\%} accurate. In the framework of the APE-QUEST project (Automated Post-Editing and Quality Estimation), we set up a case-study on the trade-off between speed, cost and quality, investigating the benefits of QE models in a real-world scenario, where we rely on end-user acceptability as quality metric. Using data in the public administration domain for English-Dutch and English-French, we experimented with two use cases: assimilation and dissemination. Results shed some light on how QE scores can be explored to establish thresholds that suit each use case and target language, and demonstrate the potential benefits of adding QE to a translation workflow."

In addition, we describe a novel error correction training regime that can be used as an auxiliary task to further improve translation robustness. Experiments on English-French and English-German translation show that both multimodal and error correction components improve model robustness to noisy texts, while still retaining translation quality on clean texts."

Recent QE models have achieved previously-unseen levels of correlation with human judgments, but they rely on large multilingual contextualized language models that are computationally expensive and make them infeasible for real-world applications. In this work, we evaluate several model compression techniques for QE and find that, despite their popularity in other NLP tasks, they lead to poor performance in this regression setting. We observe that a full model parameterization is required to achieve SoTA results in a regression task. However, we argue that the level of expressiveness of a model in a continuous range is unnecessary given the downstream applications of QE, and show that reframing QE as a classification problem and evaluating QE models using classification metrics would better reflect their actual performance in real-world applications."

A latent variable is introduced to model read or translate actions at every time step, which is then integrated out to consider all the possible translation policies. A re-parameterised Poisson prior is used to regularise the policies which allows the model to explicitly balance translation quality and latency. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the generative framework, which achieves the best BLEU scores given different average translation latencies on benchmark datasets."

When applied to neural Machine Translation (MT), it minimises the mismatch between the cross-entropy loss and non-differentiable evaluation metrics like BLEU. However, the suitability of these metrics as reward function at training time is questionable: they tend to be sparse and biased towards the specific words used in the reference texts. We propose to address this problem by making models less reliant on such metrics in two ways: (a) with an entropy-regularised RL method that does not only maximise a reward function but also explore the action space to avoid peaky distributions; (b) with a novel RL method that explores a dynamic unsupervised reward function to balance between exploration and exploitation. We base our proposals on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, adapting the off-policy maximum entropy model for language generation applications such as MT. We demonstrate that SAC with BLEU reward tends to overfit less to the training data and performs better on out-of-domain data. We also show that our dynamic unsupervised reward can lead to better translation of ambiguous words."

For that, we propose a multimodal approach to simultaneous machine translation using reinforcement learning, with strategies to integrate visual and textual information in both the agent and the environment.

This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed."

Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art neural QE models based on powerful pre-trained representations generalise well across languages, making them more applicable in real-world settings."

Our systems are based on RNN architectures with pre-trained embeddings which utilize character and sub-character information.

We find that a finer granularity embeddings can help the model according to character level evaluation and that the pre-trained embeddings can also be beneficial for model performance marginally when the training data is limited.

This problem can be addressed by generating medical data artificially. Most previous studies have focused on the generation of short clinical text, and evaluation of the data utility has been limited. We propose a generic methodology to guide the generation of clinical text with key phrases. We use the artificial data as additional training data in two key biomedical NLP tasks: text classification and temporal relation extraction. We show that artificially generated training data used in conjunction with real training data can lead to performance boosts for data-greedy neural network algorithms. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the generated data for NLP setups where it fully replaces real training data."

However, certain simplification transformations span beyond single sentences (e.g. joining and re-ordering sentences). In this paper, we motivate the need for modelling the simplification task at the document level, and assess the performance of sequence-to-sequence neural models in this setup. We analyse parallel original-simplified documents created by professional editors and show that there are frequent rewriting transformations that are not restricted to sentence boundaries. We also propose strategies to automatically evaluate the performance of a simplification model on these cross-sentence transformations. Our experiments show the inability of standard sequence-to-sequence neural models to learn these transformations, and suggest directions towards document-level simplification."

In this paper we consider grounded word sense translation, i.e. the task of correctly translating an ambiguous source word given the corresponding textual and visual context. Our main objective is to investigate the extent to which images help improve word-level (lexical) translation quality. We do so by first studying the dataset for this task to understand the scope and challenges of the task. We then explore different data settings, image features, and ways of grounding to investigate the gain from using images in each of the combinations. We find that grounding on the image is specially beneficial in weaker unidirectional recurrent translation models. We observe that adding structured image information leads to stronger gains in lexical translation accuracy."

As a consequence, models tend to learn to ignore this information. We propose a translate-and-refine approach to this problem where images are only used by a second stage decoder. This approach is trained jointly to generate a good first draft translation and to improve over this draft by (i) making better use of the target language textual context (both left and right-side contexts) and (ii) making use of visual context. This approach leads to the state of the art results. Additionally, we show that it has the ability to recover from erroneous or missing words in the source language."

We propose a novel image-aware metric for this task: VIFIDEL. It estimates the faithfulness of a generated caption with respect to the content of the actual image, based on the semantic similarity between labels of objects depicted in images and words in the description. The metric is also able to take into account the relative importance of objects mentioned in human reference descriptions during evaluation. Even if these human reference descriptions are not available, VIFIDEL can still reliably evaluate system descriptions. The metric achieves high correlation with human judgments on two well-known datasets and is competitive with metrics that depend on and rely exclusively on human references."

We posit that this is a consequence of the very simple, short and repetitive sentences used in the only available dataset for the task (Multi30K), rendering the source text sufficient as context. In the general case, however, we believe that it is possible to combine visual and textual information in order to ground translations. In this paper we probe the contribution of the visual modality to state-of-the-art MMT models by conducting a systematic analysis where we partially deprive the models from source-side textual context. Our results show that under limited textual context, models are capable of leveraging the visual input to generate better translations. This contradicts the current belief that MMT models disregard the visual modality because of either the quality of the image features or the way they are integrated into the model."

Evaluation metrics are generally benchmarked against manual assessment of translation quality, with performance measured in terms of overall correlation with human scores. Much work has been dedicated to the improvement of evaluation metrics to achieve a higher correlation with human judgments. However, little insight has been provided regarding the weaknesses and strengths of existing approaches and their behavior in different settings. In this work we conduct a broad meta-evaluation study of the performance of a wide range of evaluation metrics focusing on three major aspects. First, we analyze the performance of the metrics when faced with different levels of translation quality, proposing a local dependency measure as an alternative to the standard, global correlation coefficient. We show that metric performance varies significantly across different levels of MT quality: Metrics perform poorly when faced with low-quality translations and are not able to capture nuanced quality distinctions. Interestingly, we show that evaluating low-quality translations is also more challenging for humans. Second, we show that metrics are more reliable when evaluating neural MT than the traditional statistical MT systems. Finally, we show that the difference in the evaluation accuracy for different metrics is maintained even if the gold standard scores are based on different criteria."

The state-of-the-art approaches are heavily dependent on large volumes of back-translated data. This paper has two main contributions: Firstly, we propose new data augmentation methods to extend limited noisy data and further improve NMT robustness to noise while keeping the models small. Secondly, we explore the effect of utilizing noise from external data in the form of speech transcripts and show that it could help robustness."

This approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art automated post-editing systems. More importantly, we show that it addresses a well-known limitation of automatic post-editing - overcorrecting translations - and that our novel mechanism for copying source language words improves the results."

Evaluation of the usefulness of MT for gisting is surprisingly uncommon. The classical method uses \textit{reading comprehension questionnaires} (RCQ), in which informants are asked to answer professionally-written questions in their language about a foreign text that has been machine-translated into their language. Recently, \textit{gap-filling} (GF), a form of \textit{cloze} testing, has been proposed as a cheaper alternative to RCQ. In GF, certain words are removed from reference translations and readers are asked to fill the gaps left using the machine-translated text as a hint. This paper reports, for the first time, a comparative evaluation, using both RCQ and GF, of translations from multiple MT systems for the same foreign texts, and a systematic study on the effect of variables such as gap density, gap-selection strategies, and document context in GF. The main findings of the study are: (a) both RCQ and GF clearly identify MT to be useful; (b) global RCQ and GF rankings for the MT systems are mostly in agreement; (c) GF scores vary very widely across informants, making comparisons among MT systems hard, and (d) unlike RCQ, which is framed around documents, GF evaluation can be framed at the sentence level. These findings support the use of GF as a cheaper alternative to RCQ."

To validate our hypothesis, we focus on the {`}image{'} side of image captioning, and vary the input image representation but keep the RNN text generation model of a CNN-RNN constant. Our analysis indicates that image captioning models (i) are capable of separating structure from noisy input representations; (ii) experience virtually no significant performance loss when a high dimensional representation is compressed to a lower dimensional space; (iii) cluster images with similar visual and linguistic information together. Our experiments all point to one fact: that our distributional similarity hypothesis holds. We conclude that, regardless of the image representation, image captioning systems seem to match images and generate captions in a learned joint image-text semantic subspace."

Most recent work is based on sequence-to-sequence neural models similar to those used for machine translation (MT). Different from MT, TS data comprises more elaborate transformations, such as sentence splitting. It can also contain multiple simplifications of the same original text targeting different audiences, such as school grade levels. We explore these two features of TS to build models tailored for specific grade levels. Our approach uses a standard sequence-to-sequence architecture where the original sequence is annotated with information about the target audience and/or the (predicted) type of simplification operation.

VisEval Metric Viewer VEMV is a tool designed to provide visualisation of multiple evaluation scores so they can be easily interpreted by a user. VEMV takes in the source, reference, and hypothesis files as parameters, and scores the hypotheses using several popular evaluation metrics simultaneously.

The individual scored sentences can easily be inspected using powerful search and selection functions and results can be visualised with graphical representations of the scores and distributions."

In such contexts, encoding sufficiently descriptive image information becomes a key challenge.

We provide an in-depth analysis of end-to-end image captioning by exploring a variety of cues that can be derived from such object detections. Our study reveals that end-to-end image captioning systems rely on matching image representations to generate captions, and that encoding the frequency, size and position of objects are complementary and all play a role in forming a good image representation.

We present a neural framework that is able to accommodate neural QE approaches at these fine-grained levels and generalize them to the level of documents. We test the framework with two sentence-level neural QE approaches: a state of the art approach that requires extensive pre-training, and a new light-weight approach that we propose, which employs basic encoders. Our approach is significantly faster and yields performance improvements for a range of document-level quality estimation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first neural architecture for document-level QE. In addition, for the first time we apply QE models to the output of both statistical and neural MT systems for a series of European languages and highlight the new challenges resulting from the use of neural MT."

Our evaluation on sentences in the PA domain shows that we obtain correct simplifications for 76{\%} of the simplified cases in English, 71{\%} of the cases in Spanish. For Italian, the results are lower (38{\%}) but the tool is still under development."

While the recently introduced Newsela corpus has alleviated the first problem, simplifications still need to be learned directly from parallel text using black-box, end-to-end approaches rather than from explicit annotations. These complex-simple parallel sentence pairs often differ to such a high degree that generalization becomes difficult. End-to-end models also make it hard to interpret what is actually learned from data. We propose a method that decomposes the task of TS into its sub-problems. We devise a way to automatically identify operations in a parallel corpus and introduce a sequence-labeling approach based on these annotations. Finally, we provide insights on the types of transformations that different approaches can model."

This new level of QE aims to provide a natural balance between QE at word and sentence-level, which are either too fine grained or too coarse levels for some applications. However, phrase-level QE implies an intrinsic challenge: how to segment a machine translation into sequence of words (contiguous or not) that represent an error. We discuss three possible segmentation strategies to automatically extract erroneous phrases. We evaluate these strategies against annotations at phrase-level produced by humans, using a new dataset collected for this purpose."

In this paper, we introduce a corpus of reading comprehension tests based on machine translated documents, where we evaluate documents based on answers to questions by fluent speakers of the target language. We describe the process of creating such a resource, the experiment design and agreement between the test takers.

The goal of QE is to estimate the quality of language output applications without the need of human references. Instead, machine learning algorithms are used to build supervised models based on a few labelled training instances. Such models are able to generalise over unseen data and thus QE is a robust method applicable to scenarios where human input is not available or possible. One such a scenario where QE is particularly appealing is that of Machine Translation, where a score for predicted quality can help decide whether or not a translation is useful (e.g. for post-editing) or reliable (e.g. for gisting). Other potential applications within Natural Language Processing (NLP) include Text Summarisation and Text Simplification. In this tutorial we present the task of QE and its application in NLP, focusing on Machine Translation.

In an effort to address this limitation, we introduce SubIMDB, a corpus of everyday language spoken text we created which contains over 225 million words. The corpus was extracted from 38,102 subtitles of family, comedy and children movies and series, and is the first sizeable structured corpus of subtitles made available. Our experiments show that word frequency norms extracted from this corpus are more effective than those from well-known norms such as Kucera-Francis, HAL and SUBTLEXus in predicting various psycholinguistic properties of words, such as lexical decision times, familiarity, age of acquisition and simplicity. We also provide evidence that contradict the long-standing assumption that the ideal size for a corpus can be determined solely based on how well its word frequencies correlate with lexical decision times."

One of the main issues we face in work in this area is the lack of labelled data. While coherent (human authored) texts are abundant and incoherent texts could be taken from MT output, the latter also contains other errors which are not specifically related to coherence. This makes it difficult to identify and quantify issues of coherence in those texts. We introduce an initiative to create a corpus consisting of data artificially manipulated to contain errors of coherence common in MT output. Such a corpus could then be used as a benchmark for coherence models in MT, and potentially as training data for coherence models in supervised settings."

However, the problem of model selection in kernel-based methods is usually overlooked. Previous approaches mostly rely on setting default values for kernel hyperparameters or using grid search, which is slow and coarse-grained. In contrast, Bayesian methods allow efficient model selection by maximizing the evidence on the training data through gradient-based methods. In this paper we show how to perform this in the context of structural kernels by using Gaussian Processes. Experimental results on tree kernels show that this procedure results in better prediction performance compared to hyperparameter optimization via grid search. The framework proposed in this paper can be adapted to other structures besides trees, e.g., strings and graphs, thereby extending the utility of kernel-based methods."

It is commonly used for identifying the translation relationships between words and phrases in parallel sentences from two different languages. WA-Continuum is a tool designed for the visualisation of WAs. It was initially built to aid research studying WAs and ways to improve them. The tool relies on the automated mark-up of WAs, as typically produced by WA tools. Different from most previous work, it presents the alignment information graphically in a WA matrix that can be easily understood by users, as opposed to text connected by lines. The key features of the tool are the ability to visualise WA matrices for multiple parallel aligned sentences simultaneously in a single place, coupled with powerful search and selection components to find and inspect particular sentences as required."

These new features, along with standard MT system-independent features, are benchmarked on a series of datasets with various quality labels, including postediting effort, human translation edit rate, post-editing time and METEOR. Results show significant improvements in prediction over the baseline, as well as over systems trained on state of the art feature sets for all datasets. More notably, the addition of the newly proposed features improves over the best QE systems in WMT12 and WMT14 by a significant margin."

Our results indicate that the use of context can lead to more informative labels for quality annotation beyond sentence level."

A subset of the corpus was first manually analysed to identify its transformation operations. We then built machine learning models to attempt to automatically classify segments based on such transformations. This classification could be used, e.g., to filter out potentially noisy transformations. Our results show that the most common transformation operations performed by humans are paraphrasing (39.80%) and drop of information (26.76%), which are some of the most difficult operations to generalise from data. They are also the most difficult operations to identify automatically, with the lowest overall classifier accuracy among all operations (73% and 59%, respectively)."

It uses an error-driven strategy, i.e., it assumes that the more errors an automatically translated sentence contains, the more informative it is for the translation system. Our approach is based on a quality estimation technique which involves a wider range of features of the source text, automatic translation, and machine translation system compared to previous work. In addition, we enhance the machine translation system training data with post-edited machine translations of the sentences selected, instead of simulating this using previously created reference translations. We found that re-training systems with additional post-edited data yields higher quality translations regardless of the selection strategy used. We relate this to the fact that post-editions tend to be closer to source sentences as compared to references, making the rule extraction process more reliable."

The hypothesis is that original texts and rewritten texts exhibit significant and measurable differences, and that these can be captured through statistical and linguistic indicators. We propose and analyse a number of these indicators (including language models, syntactic trees, etc.) using machine learning algorithms in two main settings: (i) the classification of individual text segments as original or rewritten, and (ii) the ranking of two or more versions of a text segment according to their xe2x80x9coriginalityxe2x80x9d, thus rendering the rewriting direction. Different from standard plagiarism detection approaches, our settings do not involve comparisons between supposedly rewritten text and (a large number of) original texts. Instead, our work focuses on the sub-problem of finding segments that exhibit rewriting traits. Identifying such segments has a number of potential applications, from a first-stage filtering for standard plagiarism detection approaches, to intrinsic plagiarism detection and authorship identification. The corpus used in the experiments was extracted from the PAN-PC-10 plagiarism detection task, with two subsets containing manually and artificially generated plagiarism cases. The accuracies achieved are well above a by chance baseline across datasets and settings, with the statistical indicators being particularly effective."

In addition, the post-editing of automatic translations can help understand problems in such translations and this can be used as feedback for researchers and developers to improve MT systems. Finally, post-editing can be used as a way of evaluating the quality of translations in terms of how much effort these translations require in order to be fixed. We describe a standalone tool that has two main purposes: facilitate the post-editing of translations from any MT system so that they reach publishable quality and collect sentence-level information from the post-editing process, e.g.: post-editing time and detailed keystroke statistics."

In this paper we address the problems of ranking translated sentences within a document and ranking translated documents within a set of documents on the same topic according to their informativeness and translation quality. An approach combining quality estimation and sentence ranking methods is used. Experiments with French-English translation using four sets of news commentary documents show promising results for both sentence and document ranking. We believe that this approach can be useful in several practical scenarios where translation is aimed at gisting, such as multilingual media monitoring and news analysis applications."
2012.amta-wptp.2,Post-editing time as a measure of cognitive effort,2012,13,36,4,0,20837,maarit koponen,Workshop on Post-Editing Technology and Practice,0,"Post-editing machine translations has been attracting increasing attention both as a common practice within the translation industry and as a way to evaluate Machine Translation (MT) quality via edit distance metrics between the MT and its post-edited version. Commonly used metrics such as HTER are limited in that they cannot fully capture the effort required for post-editing. Particularly, the cognitive effort required may vary for different types of errors and may also depend on the context. We suggest post-editing time as a way to assess some of the cognitive effort involved in post-editing. This paper presents two experiments investigating the connection between post-editing time and cognitive effort. First, we examine whether sentences with long and short post-editing times involve edits of different levels of difficulty. Second, we study the variability in post-editing time and other statistics among editors."

However, there are fewer efforts to make information in Wikipedia in other languages accessible to a large audience. This work proposes the use of a syntactic simplification engine with high precision rules to automatically generate a Simple Portuguese Wikipedia on demand, based on user interactions with the main Portuguese Wikipedia. Our estimates indicated that a human can simplify about 28,000 occurrences of analysed patterns per million words, while our system can correctly simplify 22,200 occurrences, with estimated f-measure 77.2%."
W11-2112,{TINE}: A Metric to Assess {MT} Adequacy,2011,18,20,3,1,25928,miguel rios,Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation,0,"We describe TINE, a new automatic evaluation metric for Machine Translation that aims at assessing segment-level adequacy. Lexical similarity and shallow-semantics are used as indicators of adequacy between machine and reference translations. The metric is based on the combination of a lexical matching component and an adequacy component. Lexical matching is performed comparing bags-of-words without any linguistic annotation. The adequacy component consists in: i) using ontologies to align predicates (verbs), ii) using semantic roles to align predicate arguments (core arguments and modifiers), and iii) matching predicate arguments using distributional semantics. TINE's performance is comparable to that of previous metrics at segment level for several language pairs, with average Kendall's tau correlation from 0.26 to 0.29. We show that the addition of the shallow-semantic component improves the performance of simple lexical matching strategies and metrics such as BLEU."

Base-phrase labels and semantic role labels are incorporated into an hierarchical model by creating shallow semantic trees. Results show an increase in performance of up to 6% in BLEU scores for English-Spanish translation over a standard phrase-based SMT baseline.

An important issue that arises from the use of such technologies is measuring how much effort needs to be put in by the subtitler in post-editing (semi-)automatic translations. In this paper we present an objective way of measuring post-editing effort in terms of time. In experiments with English-Portuguese subtitles, we measure the post-editing effort of texts translated using machine translation and translation memory systems. We also contrast this effort against that of translating the texts without any tools. Results show that post-editing is on average 40% faster than translating subtitles from scratch. With our best system, more than 69% of the translations require little or no post"
R11-1031,Improving Chunk-based Semantic Role Labeling with Lexical Features,2011,15,3,3,1,5041,wilker aziz,Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2011,0,"We present an approach for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) using Conditional Random Fields in a joint identification/classification step. The approach is based on shallow syntactic information (chunks) and a number of lexicalized features such as selectional preferences and automatically inferred similar words, extracted using lexical databases and distributional similarity metrics. We use semantic annotations from the Proposition Bank for training and evaluate the system using CoNLL-2005 test sets. The additional lexical information led to improvements of 15% (in-domain evaluation) and 12% (out-of-domain evaluation) on overall semantic role classification in terms of F-measure. The gains come mostly from a better recall, which suggests that the addition of richer lexical information can improve the coverage of existing SRL models even when very little syntactic knowledge is available."

With the sharp rise in the number of electronic resources available online, an increasing number of plagiarism cases has been observed in recent years. As the amount of source materials is vast, the use of plagiarism detection tools has become the norm to aid the investigation of possible plagiarism cases. This paper describes an approach to improve plagiarism detection by incorporating a lexical generalisation technique. The goal is to identify plagiarised texts even if they are paraphrased using different words. Experiments performed on a subset of the PANxe2x80x9f10 corpus show that the matching approach involving lexical generalisation yields promising results, as compared to standard n-gram matching"

However, it is well known that the quality of a given MT system can vary significantly across translation segments and that post-editing bad quality translations is a tedious task that may require more effort than translating texts from scratch. Previous research dedicated to learning quality estimation models to flag such segments has shown that models based on human annotation achieve more promising results. However, it is not yet clear what is the most appropriate form of human annotation for building such models. We experiment with models based on three annotation types (post-editing time, post-editing distance and post-editing effort scores) and show that estimations resulting from using post-editing time, a simple and objective annotation, can reliably indicate translation post-editing effort in a practical, taskbased scenario. We also discuss some perspectives on the effectiveness, reliability and cost of each type of annotation."

The best resulting model is embedded in an authoring tool for Text Simplification."

The time necessary to post-edit bad quality translations can be the same or even longer than that of translating without an MT system. It is well known, however, that the quality of an MT system is generally not homogeneous across all translated segments. In order to make MT more useful to the translation industry, it is therefore crucial to have a mechanism to judge MT quality at the segment level to prevent bad quality translations from being post-edited within the translation workflow. We describe an approach to estimate translation post-editing effort at sentence level in terms of Human-targeted Translation Edit Rate (HTER) based on a number of features reflecting the difficulty of translating the source sentence and discrepancies between the source and translation sentences. HTER is a simple metric and obtaining HTER annotated data can be made part of the translation workflow. We show that this approach is more reliable at filtering out bad translations than other simple criteria commonly used in the translation industry, such as sentence length."

Reference-based MT evaluation metrics compare the system output against reference translations looking for overlaps at different levels (lexical, syntactic, and semantic). These metrics aim at comparing MT systems or analyzing the progress of a given system and are known to have reasonably good correlation with human judgments at the corpus level, but not at the segment level. CE metrics, on the other hand, target the system in use, providing a quality score to the end-user for each translated segment. They cannot rely on reference translations, and use instead information extracted from the input text, system output and possibly external corpora to train machine learning algorithms. These metrics correlate better with human judgments at the segment level. However, they are usually highly biased by difficulty level of the input segment, and therefore are less appropriate for comparing multiple systems translating the same input segments. We show that these two classes of metrics are complementary and can be combined to provide MT evaluation metrics that achieve higher correlation with human judgments at the segment level."

We propose using source-language monolingual models and resources to paraphrase the source text prior to translation. We further present a conceptual extension to prior work by allowing translations of entailed texts rather than paraphrases only. A method for performing this process efficiently is presented and applied to some 2500 sentences with unknown terms. Our experiments show that the proposed approach substantially increases the number of properly translated texts.

The focus is on automatically identifying a threshold to map a continuous predicted score into xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d / xe2x80x9cbadxe2x80x9d categories for filtering out bad-quality cases in a translation post-edition task. We use the theory of Inductive Confidence Machines (ICM) to identify this threshold according to a confidence level that is expected for a given task. Experiments show that this approach gives improved estimates when compared to those based on classification or regression algorithms without ICM.

Results show that our method allows obtaining good estimates and that identifying a reduced set of relevant features plays an important role. The experiments also highlight a number of outstanding features that were consistently selected as the most relevant and could be used in different ways to improve MT performance or to enhance MT evaluation."
