Dialogue acts from different dimensions are generated in parallel through several Dialogue Act Agents operating on the system’s information state. Each agent is associated with one specific dimension, and generates contributions related to that dimension only. An additional Evaluation Agent takes care of constructing combinations of dialogue acts for actual generation in system utterances. This multi-agent design allows to experiment with different dialogue strategies and styles of communication, having their specification concentrated in the Evaluation agent.

A diff culty with this model is that its grounding criterion says that “the contributor and the partners mutually believe that the partners have understood what the contributor meant”. So the grounding process is conceived in terms of mutual beliefs. However, the central problem of grounding is precisely how mutual beliefs are established. Work based on this model includes its extension to human–computer interaction by Brennan and collaborators (Brennan, 1998; Cahn and S. E. Brennan, 1999), Li et al.’s model for multimodal grounding (Li et al., 2006), and Paek and Horvitz’s formal theory of grounding (Paek and Horvitz, 2000). In his inf uential computational model of grounding, Traum (1994) has introduced separate grounding acts which are used to provide communicative feedback and thereby create mutual beliefs. For this approach to work, Traum assumes that feedback acts are always correctly perceived and understood, therefore a dialogue participant does not need feedback about his feedback acts. This is an unwarranted assumption, however. Like any dialogue utterance, an utterance which expresses feedback can suffer from the addressee temp"

Like any dialogue utterance, an utterance which expresses feedback can suffer from the addressee temporarily being disturbed by the phone, or by an aircraft f ying over, or by noise on a communication channel; hence a speaker who performs a grounding act can never be sure that his act was performed successfully until he has received some form of feedback. A limitation and somewhat confusing aspect of this model is that it discusses the grounding of utterances, rather than the grounding of information conveyed by utterances through their semantic content. (Matheson et al., 2000) use elements of Traum’s model in their treatment of grounding from the Information State Update perspective. They represent grounded and ungrounded discourse units in the information state, and change their status from ungrounded to grounded through grounding acts. The dialogue act Acknowledgement is the only grounding act implemented; its main effect is to merge the information in the acknowledged discourse unit into the grounded information. They do not deal with cases of misunderstandings or cases where the user asks for acknowledgement. The model keeps only the last two utterances in the"

The events-and participants approach seems to be stretched to its limits for verbs that take abstract concepts like thoughts, beliefs, desires, etc. as their arguments, as in “Bob wants to catch a fish”. Forms of quantification that have so far escaped a generally agreed analysis include generics and habituals, whose theoretical status has not been fully resolved; see e.g. Kamp and Reyle (1993), Section 3.7.4. Krifka et al. (1995) analyse generics in terms of a special default quantifier; others introduce a notion of ‘normal’ or ‘prototypical’ into the interpretation framework (cf.

Nuances concerning certainty, conditionality, or sentiment are captured by means of qualifiers. Moreover, dialogue acts are not produced in isolation, but various relations exists between them: functional dependence, feedback dependence and rhetorical relations, see (Bunt et al., 2018) for an updated view. ISO 24617-2 includes the specification of the XML-based Dialogue Act Markup Language (DiAML) for the representation of dialogue act annotations (Bunt et al., 2012). ISO 24617-2 dialogue act annotation scheme ISO 24617-2 (ISO, 2012) is not just a theoretically grounded and empirically tested inventory of dialogue acts with fine-grained distinctions, it presents a semantic framework for the systematic analysis and computational modelling of multimodal behaviour of dialogue participants.

The ISO 246172:2012 set of question types can be further extended to model these differences. Medical encounters also involve counselling, where doctors direct behaviour of their patients expressing their wish that the patient performs or avoids a certain action, possibly dependent on a condition. Different types of directives carry different strengths of the speaker’s assumptions about the ability and willingness of the addressee to perform an action (Bunt, 2011). 5.3. Feedback In medical interactions, it is important for the doctor not only to signal active listening but also to show a genuine interest and understanding of the patient’s behaviour by repeating the information revealed, rephrasing the previously asked questions or provided instructions, confirming or checking for understanding, consistency and validation of the information revealed. Doctors also need to encourage patients to ask questions, express their attitudes, preferences, concerns, fears and opinions. In RIAS, these acts are defined as activation strategies. 5.4.

On top of the identification of events with their time, place, and participants with their respective roles, the interpretation of quantifier and modifier structures forms the most important source of semantic information.

This enables expert annotators to assign fine-grained characterisations to segments of dialogue behaviour with high accuracy. To support manual annotation, the annotation scheme should therefore include fine-grained concepts with the level of detail that expert annotators can use. On the other hand, manual annotation is often done by annotators who do not have quite the skills of experts, partly because of the high cost, but also because it is interesting to know whether an annotation scheme can successfully be used by less skilled or even ‘naive’ annotators (Geertzen et al., 2008); for such annotators it is useful if the annotation scheme includes less fine-grained concepts. In both DIT++ and ISO 24617-2 these two requirements are met by using a hierarchically structured set of more and less specific communicative functions. UC2: Automatic annotation of human-human dialogue, or of the user’s contributions in a human-computer dialogue, typically lacks the general world knowledge and the skills of expert human annotators, and has limited access to context information - often only as far as represented in the dialogue history.

In the abstract syntax of the Dialogue Act Markup Language (DiAML) of the ISO 24617-2 scheme, an entity structure is a formal specification of a dialogue act, while link structures describe rhetorical relations between dialogue acts. The annotation structures defined by the abstract syntax can be represented (or ‘encoded’) in a many ways; XML is the most popular representation format, but other formats, such as attribute-value matrices or annotation graphs (Ide and Bunt, 2010) are equally possible. Bunt et al. (2019) describe alternative representation formats for DiAML annotation structures and how they are formally related. Every concrete syntax must satisfy two requirements: (1) completeness, which means that every structure defined by the abstract syntax has a representation, and (2) unambiguity, which means that every representation structure encodes exactly one annotation structure. These requirements are formalized in the DiAML specification by the stipulation that the concrete syntax definition includes (1) an encoding function for the structures generated"

The annotation of information about time and events using TimeML, for example, runs into problems in the annotation of quantification (as in ”every Monday” or ”most Wednesdays”), and overlaps with semantic role labelling schemes for roles of a temporal character, like the start- and end times and the duration of an event. Likewise, PDTB annotation of rhetorical relations in text (Prasad et al., 2008) struggles with occurrences of negation. Such limitations restrict the applicability of annotation schemes in use case UC1. Generality: Annotation standards are designed to be applicable across domains and applications, and therefore do not include concepts that are specific for certain domains or applications. This is part of their strength, but is sometimes also a weakness, especially for applications where it is deemed essential to include the use of specialised domain-specific concepts.

The representation of annotations in ISO DiAML makes use of the XML element <dialogueAct>, which has the following attributes: @target, whose value is a functional segment: @sender, @addressee, @otherParticipant; @dimension, @communicativeFunction; @functionalDependence and @feedback Dependence, and the three attributes @certainty, @conditionality, and @sentiment, with qualifiers as values. Additionally, rhetorical relations among dialogue acts are represented by means of <rhetoLink> elements. DiAML annotations can be extended with a semantic content, also shown in (Bunt et al., 2017), by introducing a <semanticContent> element. Consider the following ISO DiAML representation as an example: <dialogueAct xml:id=&quot;dap1&quot; sender=&quot;#p1&quot; addressee=&quot;#p2&quot; dimension=&quot;task&quot; communicativeFunction=&quot;inform&quot; target=&quot;#fsp1&quot;> <SemanticContent> <event xml:id=&quot;e1&quot; type=&quot;offer&quot;/> <Arg>10_percent</Arg> The <event> element, which specifies information about the semantic content of a dialogue act, could be the same as the element with the same name that is used in the ISO annotation schemes for time and events (ISO 24617-1), for semantic roles (ISO 24617-4), and for spatial information (ISO 24617"

The standard includes the CASCADES (Conceptual analysis, Abstract syntax, Semantics, and Concrete syntax for Annotation language DESign) annotation schemes design model (Bunt, 2015). The model enables a systematic (re-)design process: from conceptual (‘metamodel’) and semantic choices (‘abstract’ syntax) to more superficial decisions such as the choice of particular XML attributes and values (‘concrete’ syntax). The method can be used to design of a new annotation scheme or provides support for improving an existing annotation scheme through feedback loops.

Data have become essential to advance the state of the art in many areas including the development of spoken (multimodal) dialogue systems. Conversational applications such as Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google Now became successful and robust partly due to the amount of real user data available to their developers. The most recent trend in dialogue system design involves end-to-end dialogue systems using neural network models trained on previously collected dialogue data, without any detailed specification of dialogue states (Wen et al., 2017; Bayer et al., 2017). This requires large amounts of data to cover a reasonable number of possible dialogue states and participant actions.

One such aspect is the performance of the task or activity for which the dialogue takes place; another is the monitoring of each other’s attention, understanding and uptake through feedback acts; others include for instance the turn-taking process and the timing of communicative actions, and finally yet another aspect is formed by the social obligations that may arise such as greeting, apologising, or thanking. The various aspects of communication that can be addressed independently are called dimensions (Bunt and Girard, 2005; Bunt, 2006). The DIT++ tagset distinguishes 11 dimensions, which all contain a number of communicative functions that are specific to that dimension, such as TURN GIVING, PAUSING, and APOLOGY.

As it is often thought that more elaborate and fine-grained annotation schemes are difficult for annotators to apply consistently, we decided to address this issue in an annotation experiment on which we report in this paper. A frequently used way of evaluating human dialogue act classification is inter-annotator agreement. Agreement is sometimes measured as percentage of the cases on which the annotators agree, but more often expected agreement is taken into account in using the kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996), which is given by: We present a first analysis of interannotator agreement for the DIT++ tagset of dialogue acts, a comprehensive, layered, multidimensional set of 86 tags. Within a dimension or a layer, subsets of tags are often hierarchically organised. We argue that especially for such highly structured annotation schemes the well-known kappa statistic is not an adequate measure of inter-annotator agreement. Instead, we propose a statistic that takes the structural properties of the tagset into account, and we discuss the application of this statistic in an annotation experiment. The expe"

Following the suggestions in (Carletta, 1996), Core et al. consider kappa scores above 0.67 to indicate significant agreement and scores above 0.8 reliable agreement. Another more recent analysis was performed for 8 dialogues of the MONROE corpus (Stent, 2000), counting 2897 utterances in total, processed by two annotators for 13 DAMSL dimensions. Other analyses apply DAMSL derived schemes (such as SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL) to various corpora (e.g. (Di Eugenio et al., 1998; Shriberg et al., 2004) ). For the comprehensive DIT++ taxonomy, the work reported here represents the first investigation of annotator agreement. 3.2 Experiment outline As noted, existing work on annotator agreement analysis has mostly involved only two annotators. It may be argued that especially for annotation of concepts that are rather complex, an odd number of annotators is desirable. First, it allows having majority agreement unless all annotators choose entirely different. Second, it allows to deal better with the undesirable situation that one annotator chooses quite differently from the others. The 2 corpu"

Thus, as the example shows, the various functions of ‘but’ are related to different ‘dimensions’ of the interaction [4], such as the allocation of the speaker role and the processing of previous utterances.

The determination of the meanings of discourse markers is often crucial for understanding the communicated message. Discourse markers have been studied for their role in the organization of discourse structure in larger texts ([12], [16]), in argumentative dialogues ([6]), in interviews ([15], [10]) and in dialogues that are highly interactive in nature and are characterized by rapid turn switching among participants, such as task-oriented dialogues ([9]) or meeting conversations ([14]). The research reported in this paper regards the use of discourse markers in spoken dialogue. In dialogue, discourse markers play an important role in establishing boundaries between dialogue units and in indicating the communicative functions of such units (see e.g. [14], [9], [10]). 157 Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, pages 157–168"

Allwood in [1] claims that if an utterance is multifunctional, ‘its multifunctionality can be sequential and simultaneous’. Bunt in [5] examines this claim using empirical data from several dialogue annotation experiments and concludes that sequential multifunctionality disappears if we take sufficiently fine-grained dialogue units into account (so-called ‘functional segments’ rather than turns). A functional segment is defined as ‘a smallest(possibly discontinuous) stretch of communicative behaviour that has one or more communicative functions’ ([8]). It was shown in [5] that even if we consider fine-grained units of communicative behaviour we do not get rid of simultaneous multifunctionality; and the minimum number of functions that one segment may have 159 in dialogue is 1.3 on average. The number of functions grows rapidly if we take forms of multifunctionality into account such as implicated and entailed functions, feedback levels, and indirect functions. It is noticed in [5] that pragmatically implicated functions, e.g. an expression of thanks also expressing positive feedback, are a true source of multifunctionality. Logically enta"

A distinguishing feature of the proposed methodology is that the semantics is defined for the structures of the abstract syntax, rather than for the expressions that represent these structures. In this paper, we generalize the design methodology defined in (Bunt, 2010) and demonstrate its use for generating a mapping from an existing annotation scheme to a representation in GrAF format.

By way of illustration, we apply this mapping strategy to annotations from ISOTimeML, PropBank, and FrameNet. 1 Introduction The Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF, (Ide and Romary, 2004); ISO 24612, 2009) defines an abstract model for annotations together with an XML serialization of the model, the Graph Annotation Format (GrAF, (Ide and Suderman, 2007)). GrAF is intended to be a pivot format capable of representing diverse annotation types of varying complexity, guaranteeing syntactic consistency among the different annotations. GrAF does not address the issue of semantic consistency among annotation labels and categories; this is assumed to be handled by other standardization efforts such as ISOCat (Kemps-Snijders et al., 2009). ISOCat provides a set of data categories at various levels of granularity, each accompanied by a precise definition of its linguistic meaning.

More recently, the emerging ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) standard for dialogue act annotation defines dialogue acts as the ‘communicative activity of a participant in dialogue interpreted as having a certain communicative function and semantic content, and possibly also having certain functional dependence relations, rhetorical relations and feedback dependence relations’ (p. 3).

The approach is illustrated for a range of quantification phenomena, including cumulative, collective, and group quantification. 1 Introduction In 2012, two ISO standards for semantic annotation were established, one for time and events (ISO 24617-1), and one for dialogue acts (ISO 24617-2); others are under development for semantic roles, spatial information, and discourse relations. Quantification turns up as a problem in nearly all of these efforts. ISO 24617-1 has some provisions for dealing with quantification (see Pustejovsky et al., 2010), but these are too limited and do not always give correct results (Bunt and Pustejovsky, 2010). The annotation of quantification faces three main issues: 1. Which set of semantic features, expressed most likely as XML attributes and values, adequately characterize a wide range of forms of quantification; 2. Is it possible to define a formal semantics of these expressions; 3. How can the relevant features (attributes and values) be defined as components of the semantic annotations in a way that respects compositional semantics?

This approach defines a functional unit as a minimal stretch of communicative behaviour that has a communicative function (and possibly more than one function) (Geertzen et al., 2007).

The Switchboard examples in (16) illustrate this. The ISO standard makes use of nonverbal and multimodal functional segments besides purely verbal segments (see Petukhova and Bunt, 2012), and supports the functional annotation of such segments Laughter often expresses a positive emphatic sentiment concerning something that another participant just said, and thus indicates that the laughing participant understood what was said.

In logic, the study of quantification and its role in formal reasoning has long (from Aristotle to Tarski) been restricted to the use of the universal (∀, “for all”) and existential (∃, “for some”) quantifiers. Relatively recently (Mostowski, 1957; Lindstr¨om, 1966), it was noted that the universal and the existential quantifier can both be viewed as expressing a property of the involvement in a predication of sets of individual objects: the universal quantifier expresses that all the elements of a given domain are involved; the existential quantifier that at least one of the"

This paper presents an annotation scheme, called ‘QuantML’, where a range of aspects of natural language quantification are captured by a relatively small number of features, distributed over the components of annotation structures in a way that allows a compositional semantic interpretation. The QuantML scheme is based on a number of preliminary studies including Bunt (2017), Bunt et al.
