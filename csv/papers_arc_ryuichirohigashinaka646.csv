Previously, two taxonomies were proposed; one is theory-driven and the other data-driven. The former suffers from the fact that dialogue theories for human conversation are often not appropriate for categorizing errors made by chat-oriented dialogue systems. The latter has limitations in that it can only cope with errors of systems for which we have data. This paper integrates these two taxonomies to create a comprehensive taxonomy of errors in chat-oriented dialogue systems. We found that, with our integrated taxonomy, errors can be reliably annotated with a higher Fleiss{'} kappa compared with the previously proposed taxonomies."
2021.sdp-1.3,Task Definition and Integration For Scientific-Document Writing Support,2021,-1,-1,4,0,2117,hiromi narimatsu,Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing,0,"With the increase in the number of published academic papers, growing expectations have been placed on research related to supporting the writing process of scientific papers. Recently, research has been conducted on various tasks such as citation worthiness (judging whether a sentence requires citation), citation recommendation, and citation-text generation. However, since each task has been studied and evaluated using data that has been independently developed, it is currently impossible to verify whether such tasks can be successfully pipelined to effective use in scientific-document writing. In this paper, we first define a series of tasks related to scientific-document writing that can be pipelined. Then, we create a dataset of academic papers that can be used for the evaluation of each task as well as a series of these tasks. Finally, using the dataset, we evaluate the tasks of citation worthiness and citation recommendation as well as both of these tasks integrated. The results of our evaluations show that the proposed approach is promising."
2021.nlp4convai-1.25,Influence of user personality on dialogue task performance: A case study using a rule-based dialogue system,2021,-1,-1,6,0,2993,ao guo,Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI,0,"Endowing a task-oriented dialogue system with adaptiveness to user personality can greatly help improve the performance of a dialogue task. However, such a dialogue system can be practically challenging to implement, because it is unclear how user personality influences dialogue task performance. To explore the relationship between user personality and dialogue task performance, we enrolled participants via crowdsourcing to first answer specified personality questionnaires and then chat with a dialogue system to accomplish assigned tasks. A rule-based dialogue system on the prevalent Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz (MultiWOZ) task was used. A total of 211 participants{'} personalities and their 633 dialogues were collected and analyzed. The results revealed that sociable and extroverted people tended to fail the task, whereas neurotic people were more likely to succeed. We extracted features related to user dialogue behaviors and performed further analysis to determine which kind of behavior influences task performance. As a result, we identified that average utterance length and slots per utterance are the key features of dialogue behavior that are highly correlated with both task performance and user personality."

We focus on a style in which two operators interact with a user by pretending to be a single operator. For two operators to effectively act as one, each must adjust his/her conversational content and timing to the other. In the process, we expect each operator to experience the conversational content of his/her partner as if it were his/her own, creating efficient and effective learning of the other{'}s skill. We analyzed this educational effect and examined whether dialogue services can be successfully provided by collecting travel guidance dialogue data from operators who give travel information to users. In this paper, we report our preliminary results on dialogue content and user satisfaction of operators and users."

Using the framework of role play-based question answering, we collected single-turn question-answer pairs for particular characters from online users. Meta information was also collected such as emotion and intimacy related to question-answer pairs. We verified the quality of the collected data and, by subjective evaluation, we also verified their usefulness in training neural conversational models for generating utterances reflecting the meta information, especially emotion."
W18-5008,Introduction method for argumentative dialogue using paired question-answering interchange about personality,2018,0,0,2,0,28040,kazuki sakai,Proceedings of the 19th Annual {SIG}dial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue,0,"To provide a better discussion experience in current argumentative dialogue systems, it is necessary for the user to feel motivated to participate, even if the system already responds appropriately. In this paper, we propose a method that can smoothly introduce argumentative dialogue by inserting an initial discourse, consisting of question-answer pairs concerning personality. The system can induce interest of the users prior to agreement or disagreement during the main discourse. By disclosing their interests, the users will feel familiarity and motivation to further engage in the argumentative dialogue and understand the system{'}s intent. To verify the effectiveness of a question-answer dialogue inserted before the argument, a subjective experiment was conducted using a text chat interface. The results suggest that inserting the question-answer dialogue enhances familiarity and naturalness. Notably, the results suggest that women more than men regard the dialogue as more natural and the argument as deepened, following an exchange concerning personality."

The proposed method combines multiple time-asynchronous long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, which can capture speaker{'}s and collocutor{'}s multiple sequential features, and their interactions. On the assumption of applying the proposed method to spoken dialogue systems, we introduce speaker{'}s acoustic sequential features and collocutor{'}s linguistic sequential features, each of which can be extracted in an online manner. Our evaluation confirms the effectiveness of taking dialogue context formed by the speaker{'}s utterances and collocutor{'}s utterances into consideration."

Typically, many question-answer pairs are prepared by hand for achieving consistent responses; however, the creation of such pairs is costly. In this study, our goal is to collect a large number of question-answer pairs for a particular character by using role play-based question-answering in which multiple users play the roles of certain characters and respond to questions by online users. Focusing on two famous characters, we conducted a large-scale experiment to collect question-answer pairs by using real users. We evaluated the effectiveness of role play-based question-answering and found that, by using our proposed method, the collected pairs lead to good-quality chatbots that exhibit consistent personalities."

In joint modeling, common knowledge can be efficiently utilized among multiple tasks or multiple languages. This is achieved by introducing both language-specific networks shared among different tasks and task-specific networks shared among different languages. However, the shared networks are often specialized in majority tasks or languages, so performance degradation must be expected for some minor data sets. In order to improve the invariance of shared networks, the proposed method introduces both language-specific task adversarial networks and task-specific language adversarial networks; both are leveraged for purging the task or language dependencies of the shared networks. The effectiveness of the adversarial training proposal is demonstrated using Japanese and English data sets for three different utterance intent classification tasks."

A major problem in constructing lexical utterance classification modules for spoken dialogue systems is that individual data resources are often limited or unbalanced among tasks and/or languages. Various studies have examined joint learning using neural-network based shared modeling; however, previous joint learning studies focused on either cross-task or cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In order to simultaneously support both multi-task and multi-lingual joint learning, our idea is to explicitly divide state-of-the-art neural lexical utterance classification into language-specific components that can be shared between different tasks and task-specific components that can be shared between different languages. In addition, in order to effectively transfer knowledge between different task data sets and different language data sets, this paper proposes a partially-shared modeling method that possesses both shared components and components specific to individual data sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method using Japanese and English data sets with three different lexical utterance classification tasks."

Our motivation is to naturally utilize pre-trained word embeddings for probabilistic IR. To this end, key idea is to directly leverage the word embeddings as random variables for directional probabilistic models based on von Mises-Fisher distributions which are familiar to cosine distances. The proposed method enables us to theoretically take semantic similarities between document and target queries into consideration without introducing heuristic expansion techniques. In addition, this paper reveals relationships between hyperspherical QLMs and conventional QLMs. Experiments show document retrieval evaluation results in which a hyperspherical QLM is compared to conventional QLMs and document distance metrics using word or document embeddings."

However, it is not clear what types of understanding results should be conveyed to users; some utterances may be offensive and some may be too commonsensical. In this paper, we explored the effect of conveying understanding results of user utterances in a chat-oriented dialogue system by an experiment using human subjects. As a result, we found that only certain types of understanding results, such as those related to a user{'}s permanent state, are effective to improve user satisfaction. This paper clarifies the types of understanding results that can be safely uttered by a system."

The network classifies each sentence in a document into attribute and condition classes on the basis of word sequences and sentence sequences in the document. Experimental results showed the method using the proposed network significantly outperformed baseline methods by taking semantic representation of word and sentence sequential data into account. We also evaluated the network with two different product domains (insurance and tourism domains) and found that it was effective for both the domains.

Many previous studies have used the word-pair feature to compare the meaning of two sentences for implicit discourse relation recognition. Our proposed method differs in that we use various-sized sentence expression units and compare the meaning of the expressions between two sentences by converting the expressions into vectors using the RNN. Experiments showed that our method significantly improves the accuracy of identifying implicit discourse relations compared with the word-pair method.

To build such characters, utterances suitable for the designated characters are usually manually prepared. However, it is expensive to do this for a large number of utterances for various types of characters. We propose a method for automatically converting system utterances into those that are characteristic of designated personal attributes, such as gender, age and area of residence, to characterize agents. In particular, we focus on converting sentence-end expressions, which are considered to greatly affect personal attributes in Japanese. Conversion is done by (i) automatically collecting conversion candidates from various utterances on the Web (e.g., Twitter postings), and (ii) using syntactic and semantic filters to suppress the generation of ill-formed utterances. Experimental results show that our method can convert approximately 95% of utterances into those that are grammatically and semantically acceptable and approximately 90% of utterances into those that are perceived to be acceptable for designated personal attributes."

Compared to human-human conversations and task-oriented dialogues, little is known about the errors made in chat-oriented dialogue systems. Through a data collection of chat dialogues and analyses of dialogue breakdowns, we classified errors and created a taxonomy. Although the proposed taxonomy may not be complete, this paper is the first to present a taxonomy of errors in chat-oriented dialogue systems. We also highlight the difficulty in pinpointing errors in such systems."

When a dialog system participates in an open-domain conversation with a human, it is important to avoid the generation of utterances that conflict with the context of the dialog. Here, we refer to a pair of events that are not able to co-occur or that are not inconsistent with each other as a contradictory event pair. In this study, we collected contradictory event pairs using crowdsourcing and constructed a taxonomy of such pairs. We also built a large-scale database of Japanese contradictory event pairs for each class using crowdsourcing. This database will be used for consistent utterance generation in dialog systems."

To address this flexibility, previous research on conversational dialogue systems has selected system utterances from web articles based on surface cohesion and shallow semantic coherence; however, the generated utterances sometimes contain irrelevant sentences with respect to the input user utterance. We propose a template-based approach that fills templates with the most salient words in a user utterance and with related words that are extracted using web-scale dependency structures gathered from Twitter. Our open-domain conversational dialogue system outperforms retrieval-based conventional systems in chat experiments."

This paper aims to create a dictionary of 200 extended named entity (ENE) types. Using Wikipedia as a basic resource, we classify Wikipedia titles into ENE types to create an ENE dictionary. In our method, we derive a large number of features for Wikipedia titles and train a multiclass classifier by supervised learning. We devise an extensive list of features for the accurate classification into the ENE types, such as those related to the surface string of a title, the content of the article, and the meta data provided with Wikipedia. By experiments, we successfully show that it is possible to classify Wikipedia titles into ENE types with 79.63% accuracy. We applied our classifier to all Wikipedia titles and, by discarding low-confidence classification results, created an ENE dictionary of over one million entities covering 182 ENE types with an estimated accuracy of 89.48%. This is the first large scale ENE dictionary.

W10-4304,Modeling User Satisfaction Transitions in Dialogues from Overall Ratings,2010,19,17,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Proceedings of the {SIGDIAL} 2010 Conference,0,"This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting user satisfaction transitions during a dialogue only from the ratings given to entire dialogues, with the aim of reducing the cost of creating reference ratings for utterances/dialogue-acts that have been necessary in conventional approaches. In our approach, we first train hidden Markov models (HMMs) of dialogue-act sequences associated with each overall rating. Then, we combine such rating-related HMMs into a single HMM to decode a sequence of dialogue-acts into state sequences representing to which overall rating each dialogue-act is most related, which leads to our rating predictions. Experimental results in two dialogue domains show that our approach can make reasonable predictions; it significantly outperforms a baseline and nears the upper bound of a supervised approach in some evaluation criteria. We also show that introducing states that represent dialogue-act sequences that occur commonly in all ratings into an HMM significantly improves prediction accuracy."

Our method adapts the pause duration preceding agent utterances and the agent gaze duration to reduce the discomfort perceived by individual users during interaction. The experimental results showed a statistically significant tendency: the duration of the agent pause and the gaze converged during interaction with the method. The method also significantly improved the perceived relevance of the agent communicative behavior."
C10-2046,Learning to Model Domain-Specific Utterance Sequences for Extractive Summarization of Contact Center Dialogues,2010,24,5,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Coling 2010: Posters,0,"This paper proposes a novel extractive summarization method for contact center dialogues. We use a particular type of hidden Markov model (HMM) called Class Speaker HMM (CSHMM), which processes operator/caller utterance sequences of multiple domains simultaneously to model domain-specific utterance sequences and common (domain-wide) sequences at the same time. We applied the CSHMM to call summarization of transcripts in six different contact center domains and found that our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines based on the maximum coverage of important words using integer linear programming."
C10-1086,Controlling Listening-oriented Dialogue using Partially Observable {M}arkov Decision Processes,2010,14,38,2,1,40255,toyomi meguro,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2010),0,"This paper investigates how to automatically create a dialogue control component of a listening agent to reduce the current high cost of manually creating such components. We collected a large number of listening-oriented dialogues with their user satisfaction ratings and used them to create a dialogue control component using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which can learn a policy to satisfy users by automatically finding a reasonable reward function. A comparison between our POMDP-based component and other similarly motivated systems using human subjects revealed that POMDPs can satisfactorily produce a dialogue control component that can achieve reasonable subjective assessment."
W09-3917,Analysis of Listening-Oriented Dialogue for Building Listening Agents,2009,9,21,2,1,40255,toyomi meguro,Proceedings of the {SIGDIAL} 2009 Conference,0,"Our aim is to build listening agents that can attentively listen to the user and satisfy his/her desire to speak and have himself/herself heard. This paper investigates the characteristics of such listening-oriented dialogues so that such a listening process can be achieved by automated dialogue systems. We collected both listening-oriented dialogues and casual conversation, and analyzed them by comparing the frequency of dialogue acts, as well as the dialogue flows using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The analysis revealed that listening-oriented dialogues and casual conversation have characteristically different dialogue flows and that it is important for listening agents to self-disclose before asking questions and to utter more questions and acknowledgment than in casual conversation to be good listeners."
W09-3932,Effects of Conversational Agents on Human Communication in Thought-Evoking Multi-Party Dialogues,2009,23,17,3,0.889788,2119,kohji dohsaka,Proceedings of the {SIGDIAL} 2009 Conference,0,"This paper presents an experimental study that analyzes how conversational agents activate human communication in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues between multi-users and multi-agents. A thought-evoking dialogue, which is a kind of interaction in which agents act on user willingness to provoke user thinking, has the potential to stimulate multi-party interaction. In this paper, we focus on quiz-style multi-party dialogues between two users and two agents as an example of a thought-evoking multi-party dialogue. The experiment results showed that the presence of a peer agent significantly improved user satisfaction and increased the number of user utterances. We also found that agent empathic expressions significantly improved user satisfaction, raised user ratings of a peer agent, and increased user utterances. Our findings will be useful for stimulating multi-party communication in various applications such as educational agents and community facilitators."
I08-1055,Corpus-based Question Answering for why-Questions,2008,27,50,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Proceedings of the Third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Volume-{I},0,"This paper proposes a corpus-based approach for answering why-questions. Conventional systems use hand-crafted patterns to extract and evaluate answer candidates. However, such hand-crafted patterns are likely to have low coverage of causal expressions, and it is also difficult to assign suitable weights to the patterns by hand. In our approach, causal expressions are automatically collected from corpora tagged with semantic relations. From the collected expressions, features are created to train an answer candidate ranker that maximizes the QA performance with regards to the corpus of why-questions and answers. NAZEQA, a Japanese why-QA system based on our approach, clearly outperforms a baseline that uses hand-crafted patterns with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (top-5) of 0.305, making it presumably the best-performing fully implemented why-QA system."
P07-2030,Learning to Rank Definitions to Generate Quizzes for Interactive Information Presentation,2007,10,9,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Companion Volume Proceedings of the Demo and Poster Sessions,0,"This paper proposes the idea of ranking definitions of a person (a set of biographical facts) to automatically generate Who is this? quizzes. The definitions are ordered according to how difficult they make it to name the person. Such ranking would enable users to interactively learn about a person through dialogue with a system with improved understanding and lasting motivation, which is useful for educational systems. In our approach, we train a ranker that learns from data the appropriate ranking of definitions based on features that encode the importance of keywords in a definition as well as its content. Experimental results show that our approach is significantly better in ranking definitions than baselines that use conventional information retrieval measures such as tf*idf and pointwise mutual information (PMI)."
P06-1034,Learning to Generate Naturalistic Utterances Using Reviews in Spoken Dialogue Systems,2006,53,24,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"Spoken language generation for dialogue systems requires a dictionary of mappings between semantic representations of concepts the system wants to express and realizations of those concepts. Dictionary creation is a costly process; it is currently done by hand for each dialogue domain. We propose a novel unsupervised method for learning such mappings from user reviews in the target domain, and test it on restaurant reviews. We test the hypothesis that user reviews that provide individual ratings for distinguished attributes of the domain entity make it possible to map review sentences to their semantic representation with high precision. Experimental analyses show that the mappings learned cover most of the domain ontology, and provide good linguistic variation. A subjective user evaluation shows that the consistency between the semantic representations and the learned realizations is high and that the naturalness of the realizations is higher than a hand-crafted baseline."
barker-etal-2006-simulating,Simulating Cub Reporter Dialogues: The collection of naturalistic human-human dialogues for information access to text archives,2006,9,1,2,0,33318,emma barker,Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}{'}06),0,"This paper describes a dialogue data collection experiment and resulting corpus for dialogues between a senior mobile journalist and a junior cub reporter back at the office. The purpose of the dialogue is for the mobile journalist to collect background information in preparation for an interview or on-the-site coverage of a breaking story. The cub reporter has access to text archives that contain such background information. A unique aspect of these dialogues is that they capture information-seeking behavior for an open-ended task against a large unstructured data source. Initial analyses of the corpus show that the experimental design leads to real-time, mixedinitiative, highly interactive dialogues with many interesting properties."
P03-1031,Corpus-Based Discourse Understanding in Spoken Dialogue Systems,2003,18,40,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"This paper concerns the discourse understanding process in spoken dialogue systems. This process enables the system to understand user utterances based on the context of a dialogue. Since multiple candidates for the understanding result can be obtained for a user utterance due to the ambiguity of speech understanding, it is not appropriate to decide on a single understanding result after each user utterance. By holding multiple candidates for understanding results and resolving the ambiguity as the dialogue progresses, the discourse understanding accuracy can be improved. This paper proposes a method for resolving this ambiguity based on statistical information obtained from dialogue corpora. Unlike conventional methods that use hand-crafted rules, the proposed method enables easy design of the discourse understanding process. Experiment results have shown that a system that exploits the proposed method performs sufficiently and that holding multiple candidates for understanding results is effective."
C02-2008,Interactive Paraphrasing Based on Linguistic Annotation,2002,3,3,1,1,1442,ryuichiro higashinaka,{COLING} 2002: The 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Project Notes,0,"We propose a method Interactive Paraphrasing which enables users to interactively paraphrase words in a document by their definitions, making use of syntactic annotation and word sense annotation. Syntactic annotation is used for managing smooth integration of word sense definitions into the original document, and word sense annotation for retrieving the correct word sense definition for a word in a document. In this way, documents can be paraphrased so that they fit into the original context, preserving the semantics and improving the readability at the same time. No extra layer (window) is necessary for showing the word sense definition as in conventional methods, and other natural language processing techniques such as summarization, translation, and voice synthesis can be easily applied to the results."
