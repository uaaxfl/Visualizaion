Possible ways of treatment of cataphoric connectives in GeCzLex are still under debate. 6.3. Non-Adjacency and German Connectives The original research question was driven by the hypothesis that connectives with an explicit referential element, which the German “Pronominaladverbien” largely are, are more likely to introduce relations with a non-adjacent left (external) argument. However, Stede and Grishina (2016) in their work on German anaphoric connectives report that the absence of an explicitly anaphoric morpheme in the connective does not exclude its anaphoric behavior. We can support this claim by having detected German connectives in the discourse-annotated data of Potsdam Commentary Corpus that take a non-adjacent external argument, cf. Example 7. They are dann (then) and allerdings (however). These two connectives do not agree with the formal AC definition. The other way round, there were no instances detected of a German pronominal adverb with a distant external argument. Nevertheless, it mu"

Treq (Vavˇr´ın and Rosen, 2015) is a tool for automatic searching of translation equivalents in the parallel InterCorp data. It enables to specify the desired language pair (where, currently, Czech or English serve as pivots), and subsequently to search for translation equivalents on the level of a specific word form, a lemma, a multiword unit or using regular expressions.

In Section 5, the structure of the lexicon is described along with an example of a lexicon entry, and we conclude with a discussion about the pros and cons of our approach and possible extensions (Sections 6 and 7). Recent years witnessed a boom in the development of electronic resources describing discourse relational devices (DRDs), or, more specifically, discourse markers and connectives in different languages (e.g. Feltracco et al. (2016), Mendes and Lejeune (2016), Das et al. (2018)). Efforts in this area were largely supported by the TextLink initiative,1 which brought together discourse-oriented researchers from across Europe and some other countries. During the last two years, the first ones of these monolingual connective lexicons have been interlinked, and those developed later on then incrementally added, resulting in Connective-Lex, a multilingual connective database (Stede et al., 2019).

For measuring the inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of semantic inter-sentential discourse relations in PDT, we have chosen two measures. The relations do not form natural chains (unlike e.g. textual and grammatical coreference) and a simple F1-measure is well suited for the agreement on existence of the relations. For the agreement on types of the relations, which is a typical classification task, we use Cohen's κ.

For assigning semantic relations in the discourse, we developed a set of 22 discourse-semantic tags (Mladová et al., 2009). It is inspired partly by the set of semantic labels used for the annotation of the tectogrammatical layer in PDT 2.0, relations within the sentence (the tectogrammatical syntactico-semantic labels called functors, Mikulová et al., 2005) – since some of the semantic relations apply also intra-sententially, like causal or contrastive relations; and partly by the set of semantic tags in the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 (Prasad et al., 2008), a discourse annotation project for English with similar aims. Hence, there are three important issues for the inter-annotator measurement on the discourse level of annotation in PDT: the agreement on the start and target nodes of the discourse relation (and so the extent of the discourse arguments), the agreement on the discourse connective assigned to the relation, and, last but not least, the agreement on the semantic type of the relation. 3 3.1 Figure 1.

The nodes on the analytical layer (except for technical roots of the trees) also correspond 1:1 to the tokens of the sentences. The order of the nodes from left to right corresponds exactly to the surface order of tokens in the sentence (attribute ord).

Detailed annotation guidelines that constitute the basis of the handling with the language material were developed (Mikulová et al., 2005) based on the theoretical assumptions of the Functional Generative Grammar (for the first formulations of this formal framework, see Sgall, 1967; Sgall et al., 1986). The annotation of the information structure in PDT is also based on this theory. The same linguistic approach was used in some other annotation schemes connected with the annotation of topic-focus articulation (e.g. Postolache, 2005). In the past three or four decades, topic-focus articulation (known also as sentence information structure) is a language phenomenon that has attracted an enormous interest in linguistics and has become a “hot” topic of linguistic studies. No wonder then, that these days several linguistic teams (e.g. at the University of Potsdam, University of Berlin, University of Stuttgart, Charles University in Prague) have attempted to include the annotation of information structure in the annotating schemes they propose.

According to reports, however, the English club abandons the typical island football, which could be an advantage. 3.1 Discourse Annotating discourse relations in PDiT is inspired by the PDTB lexical approach of connective identification (Prasad et. al., 2008) but it also takes advantage of the Prague tradition of dependency treebanking. This means in practice that some discourse information (intra-sentential) could have been extracted from the previous rich annotation of syntax, with only minor enhancements (Jínová et al., 2012b). In the first release of PDiT, we only focused on discourse relations indicated by overly present (explicit) discourse connectives, i.e. expressions like but, however, as a result, even though etc.3 Every DC is thought of as a discourse-level predicate that 3 Some remarks on annotation of the implicit DCs and of the so-called alternative lexicalizations of connectives (AltLex) are added in the discussion in Section 6. 93 takes two discourse units as its arguments.

Introduction Over the last years, cross-lingual studies have been attracting a great deal of attention. Cross-lingual studies on discourse phenomena are no exception, mainly motivated by the task of machine translation, which still often overlooks phenomena beyond the sentence span. Corpora annotated with coreference are arguably a valuable resource for such studies. However, they are mostly monolingual. To our best knowledge, coreference-annotated parallel corpora are very rare, with ParCor 1.0 (Guillou et al., 2014), and the original release of Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Hajiˇc et al., 2012, PCEDT) being the main representatives.

Therefore, we present the number of entities consisting of more than one mention (non-singleton entities), and include only these entities in the statistics of alignment in Section 4. 4. Improved alignment of coreferential expressions An essential part of each parallel corpus is the alignment between languages. Except for sentence alignment, texts in PCEDT are also aligned on the word level. Originally, the word alignment in PCEDT was produced in an unsupervised way by the GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2000). GIZZA++ was run in both directions; then, symmetrization of the two produced alignments was taken.9 The alignment on the tectogrammatical layer, that is, the layer containing coreference annotation, was obtained by projecting the word alignment. Furthermore, a simple heuristics was applied for elided subjects reconstructed in the tectogrammatical tree. The unsupervised approach of word alignment seems to be working sufficiently well for most of the words, especially for auto-semantic words. Nonetheless, its performance falls behind for words such as pronouns, not to speak of zeros unexpresse"

The intuition which is behind this ranking of transitions is very close to those behind the notion of the low cost effort (Fais, 2004, p.120): “utterances that „continue‟ the „topic‟ of a previous sentence in a prominent position impose a lower inferential load, and are thus more coherent, than utterances which relegate the topic to less prominent position or which change the topic”.

Related Theories One of the most deeply elaborated and best known theories of discourse (local) coherence is the so-called centering theory (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1983) based on the model of the local attentional states of speakers and hearers as proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). Each utterance in discourse is considered to contain a backward looking center, which links it with the preceding utterance, and a set of entities called forward looking centers; these entities are ranked according to languagespecific ranking principles stated in terms of syntactic functions of the referring expressions. The highest ranked entity on the list is the so-called preferred center, i.e. the most likely link to the next following utterance. The transitions from one utterance to the following one are then specified by rules that capture their ordering: the most preferred is „continu"

It is an abstract XML-based format designed for annotation of treebanks. For editing and processing data in PML format, a fully customizable tree editor TrEd has been implemented (Pajas & Štěpánek 2008). TrEd can be easily customized to a desired purpose by extensions that are included into the system as modules. In this section, we describe some features of an extension that has been implemented for our purposes. The data scheme used in PDT 2.0 has been slightly extended to support the annotation of the extended textual coreference (that has – unlike the originally annotated textual coreference – a type) and the bridging anaphora (that has not been annotated before and also has a type).

The MUC is considered to be the most standard annotation scheme (Hirschman, 1997) and it is used in more than one application (MUC-6, MUC-7, ACE). The advantage of this scheme is its simplicity and a very detailed linguistically oriented coding scheme. It has been however criticized for its vague interpretation of the notion of coreference and for the limited coverage of relations (only identical relation between nouns is annotated). One of the most well known later approaches is MATE (Poesio, 2004) and its extension on the GNOME corpus. The project is meant to be multi-functional. The annotation scheme was primarily developed for dialog acts analyses, but may be easily adapted for any other investigation. In the extended GNOME scheme, the identical coreference is annotated along with some bridging relations, such as ELEMENT, SUBSET, POSSession and OTHER for underspecified relations. In PoCoS (Krasavina and Chiarchos, 2007), a two layer coreference annotation scheme was suggested: the Core Layer is general and reusable, while the Extended Layer supports a wider range of specific extensio"

The group of so called “nearidentity” relations, where the discourse entities to which the noun phrases refer cannot be called coreferential in all senses but still are rather coreferential than not, was separated from the cases of full-coreference. Coreference was thus redefined as a scalar relation between linguistic expressions that 2 refer to discourse entities considered to be at the same granularity level relevant to the linguistic and pragmatic context (Recasens et al. 2011).

For the semantic layer of PDT, there also exists annotation of coreference (Nedoluzhko et al., 2011), and discourse (as the only annotated corpus of Czech; see Poláková et al., 2012a). Discourse relations are marked between two verbal arguments (i.e. two relevant parts of text) if they are signalled by a certain discourse marker – see an example from PDT: (1) The mattress was terrible, no quality at first sight.

In the first stage of discourse annotation in PDT (i.e. annotation of Czech data), the annotators (trained students of linguistics) were asked to fill a comment “AltLex” to such expressions that function in the text, according to their interpretation, as Czech AltLexes.

All these approaches are based on the interplay between the ordering introduced by edges in a tree and the linear ordering of tree nodes. All these approaches look at the problem from the point of view of complexity of word order. An alternative approach to the problem of measuring the word-order freedom has been introduced in (Kuboˇn et al., 2012). This approach is based on a number of word order shifts2 necessary for correct analysis by reduction. Contrary to treebased measures, the number of shifts can somehow express the degree of word order freedom (or the number of strict word-order co"

The text of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the discourse-annotated treebank used as the source data for the lexicon, in Section 3, the structure of the lexicon and properties of its entries are described, and CzeDLex is also compared to (mostly) DiMLex. Section 4 describes technical aspects of the lexicon development,"

As stated earlier, the main source of inspiration was the German machine-readable Lexicon of Discourse Markers, DiMLex, developed since 1998 (Stede and Umbach, 1998) and continuously enhanced (DimLex 2, Scheffler and Stede, 2016). Like DiMLex, CzeDLex is encoded in XML (see Section 4.1 below), covers the part-of-speech, syntactic and semantic properties of the items described. Semantic properties are described via similar frameworks – a variant of the PDTB sense taxonomy (the PDTB version 3 for DiMLex versus Prague adjustments of the PDTB version 2.0 for CzeDLex). The core of the category of discourse connectives/markers is determined quite in agreement, although independently: DiMLex adopts the definition from Pasch et al. (2003), CzeDLex is inspired by"
