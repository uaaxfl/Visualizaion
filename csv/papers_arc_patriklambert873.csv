In each case, there can be many variables, such as the amount of training data available, and the quality requirements of the end user. These variables can have an impact on the robustness of Neural MT engines. On the whole, Neural MT cures many ills of other MT paradigms, but at the same time, it has introduced a new set of challenges to address. In this paper, we describe some of the specific issues with practical NMT and the approaches we take to improve model robustness in real-world scenarios."
P19-2035,Attention and Lexicon Regularized {LSTM} for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,2019,0,2,2,0,25514,lingxian bao,Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop,0,"Abstract Attention based deep learning systems have been demonstrated to be the state of the art approach for aspect-level sentiment analysis, however, end-to-end deep neural networks lack flexibility as one can not easily adjust the network to fix an obvious problem, especially when more training data is not available: e.g. when it always predicts \textit{positive} when seeing the word \textit{disappointed}. Meanwhile, it is less stressed that attention mechanism is likely to {``}over-focus{''} on particular parts of a sentence, while ignoring positions which provide key information for judging the polarity. In this paper, we describe a simple yet effective approach to leverage lexicon information so that the model becomes more flexible and robust. We also explore the effect of regularizing attention vectors to allow the network to have a broader {``}focus{''} on different parts of the sentence. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Although much research in multi-lingual and cross-lingual sentiment analysis has focused on unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches, these still require a large number of resources and do not reach the performance of supervised approaches. With this in mind, we introduce two datasets for supervised aspect-level sentiment analysis in Basque and Catalan, both of which are under-resourced languages. We provide high-quality annotations and benchmarks with the hope that they will be useful to the growing community of researchers working on these languages."

Almost all research into CLSC has been carried out at sentence and document level, although this level of granularity is often less useful. This paper explores methods for performing aspect-based cross-lingual sentiment classification (aspect-based CLSC) for under-resourced languages. Given the limited nature of parallel data for many languages, we would like to make the most of this resource for our task. We compare zero-shot learning, bilingual word embeddings, stacked denoising autoencoder representations and machine translation techniques for aspect-based CLSC. Each of these approaches requires differing amounts of parallel data. We show that models based on distributed semantics can achieve comparable results to machine translation on aspect-based CLSC and give an analysis of the errors found for each method."

Aspect-level CLSC, which is more appropriate for many applications, presents the additional difficulty that we consider subsentential opinionated units which have to be mapped across languages. In this paper, we extend the possible cross-lingual sentiment analysis settings to aspect-level specific use cases. We propose a method, based on constrained SMT, to transfer opinionated units across languages by preserving their boundaries. We show that cross-language sentiment classifiers built with this method achieve comparable results to monolingual ones, and we compare different cross-lingual settings."

Aiming at bringing together researchers and practitioners from the different multidisciplinary areas working in these directions, as well as at creating a brainstorming and discussion venue for Hybrid Translation approaches, the HyTra initiative was born.

This tool can give translation suggestions adapted to the scientific domain, improving by more than 10 points the BLEU score of a generic system.

Over the last years, a variety of automatic evaluation measures have been studied, some of them like Word Error Rate (WER), Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER) and BLEU and NIST scores have become widely used tools for comparing different systems as well as for evaluating improvements within one system. However, these measures do not give any details about the nature of translation errors. Therefore some analysis of the generated output is needed in order to identify the main problems and to focus the research efforts. On the other hand, human evaluation is a time consuming and expensive task.
