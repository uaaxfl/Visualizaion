In this work, we first show that state-of-the-art systems, recent neural essay scoring systems, might be also influenced by the correlation between essay length and scores in a standard dataset. In our evaluation, a very simple neural model shows the state-of-the-art performance on the standard dataset. To consider essay content without taking essay length into account, we introduce a simple neural model assessing the similarity of content between an input essay and essays assigned different scores. This neural model achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on a standard dataset as well as on a second dataset. Our findings suggest that neural essay scoring systems should consider the characteristics of datasets to focus on text quality."

We collect high-quality, real-world cross-lingual data from Spektrum der Wissenschaft, which publishes human-written German scientific summaries of English science articles on various subjects. The generated Spektrum dataset is small; therefore, we harvest a similar dataset from the Wikipedia Science Portal to complement it. The Wikipedia dataset consists of English and German articles, which can be used for monolingual and cross-lingual summarization. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of the datasets and results of empirical experiments with several existing extractive and abstractive summarization models. The results suggest the viability and usefulness of the proposed dataset for monolingual and cross-lingual summarization."

However, it is not clear how to integrate hyperbolic components into downstream tasks. This is the first work that proposes a fully hyperbolic model for multi-class multi-label classification, which performs all operations in hyperbolic space. We evaluate the proposed model on two challenging datasets and compare to different baselines that operate under Euclidean assumptions. Our hyperbolic model infers the latent hierarchy from the class distribution, captures implicit hyponymic relations in the inventory, and shows performance on par with state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained classification with remarkable reduction of the parameter size. A thorough analysis sheds light on the impact of each component in the final prediction and showcases its ease of integration with Euclidean layers."

In this work, we propose a coherence model which takes discourse structural information into account without relying on human annotations. We approximate a linguistic theory of coherence, Centering theory, which we use to track the changes of focus between discourse segments. Our model first identifies the focus of each sentence, recognized with regards to the context, and constructs the structural relationship for discourse segments by tracking the changes of the focus. The model then incorporates this structural information into a structure-aware transformer. We evaluate our model on two tasks, automated essay scoring and assessing writing quality. Our results demonstrate that our model, built on top of a pretrained language model, achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks. We next statistically examine the identified trees of texts assigned to different quality scores. Finally, we investigate what our model learns in terms of theoretical claims."

Humans read sentences one-by-one, incrementally. Can neural models benefit by interpreting texts incrementally as humans do? We investigate this question in coherence modeling. We propose a coherence model which interprets sentences incrementally to capture lexical relations between them.

Our findings show (1) the requirements for embeddings, used in resolvers, and for coreference resolutions are, by design, in conflict and (2) adversarial approaches are sometimes not legitimate to mitigate the obstacles, as they may falsely introduce mention overlaps in adversarial training and test sets, thus giving an inflated impression for the improvements."

We evaluate on two datasets and propose two different techniques to extract hierarchical information from the type inventory: from an expert-generated ontology and by automatically mining the dataset. The hyperbolic model shows improvements in some but not all cases over its Euclidean counterpart. Our analysis suggests that the adequacy of this geometry depends on the granularity of the type inventory and the representation of its distribution.

In this work, we conduct an extensive evaluation comparing non-contextual subword embeddings, namely FastText and BPEmb, and a contextual representation method, namely BERT, on multilingual named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. We find that overall, a combination of BERT, BPEmb, and character representations works best across languages and tasks. A more detailed analysis reveals different strengths and weaknesses: Multilingual BERT performs well in medium- to high-resource languages, but is outperformed by non-contextual subword embeddings in a low-resource setting."

The use of maximum spans tangles coreference evaluation with the challenges of mention boundary detection like prepositional phrase attachment. To address this problem, minimum spans are manually annotated in smaller corpora. However, this additional annotation is costly and therefore, this solution does not scale to large corpora. In this paper, we propose the MINA algorithm for automatically extracting minimum spans to benefit from minimum span evaluation in all corpora. We show that the extracted minimum spans by MINA are consistent with those that are manually annotated by experts. Our experiments show that using minimum spans is in particular important in cross-dataset coreference evaluation, in which detected mention boundaries are noisier due to domain shift. We have integrated MINA into https://github.com/ns-moosavi/coval for reporting standard coreference scores based on both maximum and automatically detected minimum spans."

Since subwords increase parameter sharing ability in neural models, their value should be even more pronounced in low-data regimes. In this work, we therefore provide a comprehensive analysis focused on the usefulness of subwords for word representation learning in truly low-resource scenarios and for three representative morphological tasks: fine-grained entity typing, morphological tagging, and named entity recognition. We conduct a systematic study that spans several dimensions of comparison: 1) type of data scarcity which can stem from the lack of task-specific training data, or even from the lack of unannotated data required to train word embeddings, or both; 2) language type by working with a sample of 16 typologically diverse languages including some truly low-resource ones (e.g. Rusyn, Buryat, and Zulu); 3) the choice of the subword-informed word representation method. Our main results show that subword-informed models are universally useful across all language types, with large gains over subword-agnostic embeddings. They also suggest that the effective use of subwords largely depends on the language (type) and the task at hand, as well as on the amount of available data for training the embeddings and task-based models, where having sufficient in-task data is a more critical requirement."

Bridging resolution involves recognizing bridging anaphors and finding links to antecedents. In contrast to most prior work, we tackle both problems. Our work also follows a more wide-ranging definition of bridging than most previous work and does not impose any restrictions on the type of bridging anaphora or relations between anaphor and antecedent. We create a corpus (ISNotes) annotated for information status (IS), bridging being one of the IS subcategories. The annotations reach high reliability for all categories and marginal reliability for the bridging subcategory. We use a two-stage statistical global inference method for bridging resolution. Given all mentions in a document, the first stage, bridging anaphora recognition, recognizes bridging anaphors as a subtask of learning fine-grained IS. We use a cascading collective classification method where (i) collective classification allows us to investigate relations among several mentions and autocorrelation among IS classes and (ii) cascaded classification allows us to tackle class imbalance, important for minority classes such as bridging. We show that our method outperforms current methods both for IS recognition overall as well as for bridging, specifically. The second stage, bridging antecedent selection, finds the antecedents for all predicted bridging anaphors. We investigate the phenomenon of semantically or syntactically related bridging anaphors that share the same antecedent, a phenomenon we call sibling anaphors. We show that taking sibling anaphors into account in a joint inference model improves antecedent selection performance. In addition, we develop semantic and salience features for antecedent selection and suggest a novel method to build the candidate antecedent list for an anaphor, using the discourse scope of the anaphor. Our model outperforms previous work significantly."

It is used in tasks and domains for which we do not necessarily have coreference annotated corpora. Therefore, generalization is of special importance for coreference resolution. However, while recent coreference resolvers have notable improvements on the CoNLL dataset, they struggle to generalize properly to new domains or datasets. In this paper, we investigate the role of linguistic features in building more generalizable coreference resolvers. We show that generalization improves only slightly by merely using a set of additional linguistic features. However, employing features and subsets of their values that are informative for coreference resolution, considerably improves generalization. Thanks to better generalization, our system achieves state-of-the-art results in out-of-domain evaluations, e.g., on WikiCoref, our system, which is trained on CoNLL, achieves on-par performance with a system designed for this dataset."

We encode the perceived coherence of a text by a vector, which represents patterns of changes in salient information that relates adjacent sentences. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is beneficial for two downstream tasks: Readability assessment, in which our model achieves new state-of-the-art results; and essay scoring, in which the combination of our coherence vectors and other task-dependent features significantly improves the performance of a strong essay scorer."

This profile is then used to automatically verify each linked mention individually, i.e., to predict whether it has been linked correctly or not. Verification allows leveraging a rich set of global and pairwise features that would be prohibitively expensive for EL systems employing global inference. Evaluation shows consistent improvements across datasets and systems.

P14-2006,Scoring Coreference Partitions of Predicted Mentions: A Reference Implementation,2014,19,67,6,0,11322,sameer pradhan,Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),0,": The definitions of two coreference scoring metrics- B3 and CEAF-are underspecified with respect to predicted, as opposed to key (or gold) mentions. Several variations have been proposed that manipulate either, or both, the key and predicted mentions in order to get a one-to-one mapping. On the other hand, the metric BLANC was, until recently, limited to scoring partitions of key mentions. In this paper, we (i) argue that mention manipulation for scoring predicted mentions is unnecessary, and potentially harmful as it could produce unintuitive results; (ii) illustrate the application of all these measures to scoring predicted mentions; (iii) make available an open-source, thoroughly-tested reference implementation of the main coreference evaluation measures; and (iv) rescore the results of the CoNLL-2011/2012 shared task systems with this implementation. This will help the community accurately measure and compare new end-to-end coreference resolution algorithms."

This paper proposes a rule-based approach for the challenging task of unrestricted bridging resolution, where bridging anaphors are not limited to definite NPs and semantic relations between anaphors and their antecedents are not restricted to meronymic relations. The system consists of eight rules which target different relations based on linguistic insights. Our rule-based system significantly outperforms a reimplementation of a previous rule-based system (Vieira and Poesio, 2000). Furthermore, it performs better than a learning-based approach which has access to the same knowledge resources as the rule-based system. Additionally, incorporating the rules and more features into the learning-based system yields a minor improvement over the rule-based system."

The informativeness score is learned robustly during few iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm. The proposed unsupervised system outperforms existing unsupervised methods on all benchmark data sets.

The concept inventory comes from WikiNet, a large-scale concept network derived from Wikipedia. The distinctive feature of these representations are their relation to a concept network, through which we can compute selectional preferences of open-class words relative to general concepts. The resource thus derived provides a meaning representation that complements the relational representation captured in the concept network. It covers English open-class words, but the concept base is language independent. The resource can be extended to other languages, with the use of language specific dependency parsers. Good results in metonymy resolution show the resource's potential use for NLP applications."

We expand such approaches by taking into account the larger context. Our algorithm is tested on the data from the metonymy resolution task (Task 8) at SemEval 2007. The results show that incorporation of the global context can improve over the use of the local context alone, depending on the types of metonymies addressed. As a second contribution, we move towards unsupervised resolution of metonymies, made feasible by considering ontological relations as possible readings. We show that such an unsupervised approach delivers promising results: it beats the supervised most frequent sense baseline and performs close to a supervised approach using only standard lexico-syntactic features."

Concept and entity disambiguation is the task of identifying the correct concept or entity in a knowledge base for a single- or multi-word noun (mention) given its context. Concept and entity clustering is the task of clustering mentions so that all mentions in one cluster refer to the same concept or entity. The proposed model (1) is global, i.e. a group of mentions in a text is disambiguated in one single step combining various global and local features, and (2) performs disambiguation, unknown concept and entity detection and clustering jointly. The disambiguation is performed with respect to Wikipedia. The model is trained once on Wikipedia articles and then applied to and evaluated on different data sets originating from news papers, audio transcripts and internet sources."

For most applications, however, it is not only necessary to derive the polarity of a text as a whole but also to extract negative and positive utterances on a more finegrained level. Sentiment analysis systems working on the (sub-)sentence level, however, are difficult to develop since shorter textual segments rarely carry enough information to determine their polarity out of context. In this paper, therefore, we present a fully automatic framework for fine-grained sentiment analysis on the subsentence level combining multiple sentiment lexicons and neighborhood as well as discourse relations to overcome this problem. We use Markov logic to integrate polarity scores from different sentiment lexicons with information about relations between neighboring segments, and evaluate the approach on product reviews. The experiments show that the use of structural features improves the accuracy of polarity predictions achieving accuracy scores of up to 69%."

When applied to the whole data set the feature produced a smaller but still significant improvement."

An important requirement for such a system is the automatic detection of the domain and a domain consistency check of the given speech recognition hypotheses. We report a pilot study addressing these tasks, the underlying data collection and investigate the feasibility of annotating the data reliably by human annotators."

We argue that for multimodal data, an iterative data collection strategy should be followed. Instead of a single major data collection effort using a xe2x80x9cWizard of OZxe2x80x9d (WOZ) or xe2x80x9cpromptingxe2x80x9d experimental setup, several smaller data collections should accompany the system development. We also describe the xe2x80x9cscriptxe2x80x9d experimental setup we developed. It is in between the WOZ and prompting setup, and can be used as a cost effective design for the first data collection within the iterative data collection strategy."

Results based on the annotation of twelve texts from four genres show that only a few factors have a strong influence on pronominalization across genres, i.e. distance from last mention, agreement, and form of the antecedent. Finally, we describe a probabilistic model of pronominalization derived from our data."
W99-0107,Building a Tool for Annotating Reference in Discourse,1999,21,6,2,0,54907,jonathan decristofaro,The Relation of Discourse/Dialogue Structure and Reference,0,"We discuss the development of a system for marking several types of reference to facilitate the analysis of reference in discourse. The tool is designed to be used in three applicationsi generating training data for machine learning of co-reference relations, evaluating iheories of referring expression generation and resolution in texts, and developing theories for understanding reference in dialogs. The need to mark any of a broad set of relations which may span several levels of discourse structure drives the system architecture. The system has the abilityto collect statistics over encoded relations and meastwe inter-coder reliability, and includes tools to increase the accuracy of the user's markings by highlighting the di.u:repancies between two sets of markings. Using parsed corpora as the input further reduces the human workload and increases reliability."
W99-0108,Generating Anaphoric Expressions: Pronoun or Definite Description?,1999,31,33,2,0,31670,kathleen mccoy,The Relation of Discourse/Dialogue Structure and Reference,0,"In order to produce coherent text. natural language generation systems must have the ability to generate pronouns in the appropriate places. In the past, pronoun usage was primarily investigated with respect to the accessibility of referents. We.argue that generating appropriate referring expressions requires looking at factors beyond accessibility. Also important are sentence boundaries, distance from last mention, discourse structure and ambiguity. We present an algorithm for generating appropriate anaphoric expressions which takes the tent poral structure of texts and knowledge about ambiguous contexts into account. We back up our hypotheses with some empirical results indicating that our algorithm chooses the right referring expression in 85% of the cases."
J99-3001,Functional Centering {--} Grounding Referential Coherence on Information Structure,1999,55,147,1,1,869,michael strube,Computational Linguistics,0,"Considering empirical evidence from a free-word-order language (German) we propose a revision of the principles guiding the ordering of discourse entities in the forward-looking center list within the centering model. We claim that grammatical role criteria should be replaced by criteria that reflect the functional information structure of the utterances. These new criteria are based on the distinction between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities. We demonstrate that such a functional model of centering can be successfully applied to the analysis of several forms of referential text phenomena, viz. pronominal, nominal, and functional anaphora. Our methodological and empirical claims are substantiated by two evaluation studies. In the first one, we compare success rates for the resolution of pronominal anaphora that result from a grammatical-role-driven centering algorithm and from a functional centering algorithm. The second study deals with a new cost-based evaluation methodology for the assessment of centering data, one which can be directly derived from and justified by the cognitive load premises of the centering model."

This paper describes an algorithm for the resolution of discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute a large percentage of anaphors in spoken dialogues. The success of the resolution is dependent on the classification of all pronouns and demonstratives into individual, discourse deictic and vague anaphora. Finally, the empirical results of the application of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dialogues are presented."
