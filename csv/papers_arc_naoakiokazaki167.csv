The first technology is a summarization component, which is used for generating news headlines. This component is a transformer-based abstractive text summarization system which is trained to output headlines from the leading sentences of news articles. The second technology is machine translation (MT), which enables users to read foreign news articles in their mother language. Since the system uses MT, users can immediately access the latest foreign news. 139 Japanese LINE users participated in the field experiments for two weeks, viewing about 40,000 articles which had been translated from English to Japanese. We carried out surveys both during and after the experiments. According to the results, 79.3{\%} of users evaluated the headlines as adequate, while 74.7{\%} of users evaluated the automatically translated articles as intelligible. According to the post-experiment survey, 59.7{\%} of users wished to continue using the system; 11.5{\%} of users did not. We also report several statistics of the experiments."

We propose methods for fine-tuning pre-trained masked language models (BERT) for context-aware antonym prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that these methods have positive impacts on the prediction of antonyms within a context. Moreover, human evaluation reveals that more than 85{\%} of predictions using the proposed method are acceptable as antonyms."

Previous methods using Transformer-based models generate a headline including a given phrase by providing the encoder with additional information corresponding to the given phrase. However, these methods cannot always include the phrase in the generated headline. Inspired by previous RNN-based methods generating token sequences in backward and forward directions from the given phrase, we propose a simple Transformer-based method that guarantees to include the given phrase in the high-quality generated headline. We also consider a new headline generation strategy that takes advantage of the controllable generation order of Transformer. Our experiments with the Japanese News Corpus demonstrate that our methods, which are guaranteed to include the phrase in the generated headline, achieve ROUGE scores comparable to previous Transformer-based methods. We also show that our generation strategy performs better than previous strategies."

In particular, pronouns of subject, object, and possessive cases are often omitted in Japanese; these are known as zero pronouns. In translation from Japanese to other languages, we need to find a correct antecedent for each zero pronoun to generate a correct and coherent translation. However, it is difficult for conventional automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) to focus on the success of zero pronoun resolution. Therefore, we present a hand-crafted dataset to evaluate whether translation models can resolve the zero pronoun problems in Japanese to English translations. We manually and statistically validate that our dataset can effectively evaluate the correctness of the antecedents selected in translations. Through the translation experiments using our dataset, we reveal shortcomings of an existing context-aware neural machine translation model."

Our proposed method, optimizing tokenization (OpTok), is trained to assign a high probability to such appropriate tokenization based on the downstream task loss. OpTok can be used for any downstream task which uses a vector representation of a sentence such as text classification. Experimental results demonstrate that OpTok improves the performance of sentiment analysis and textual entailment. In addition, we introduce OpTok into BERT, the state-of-the-art contextualized embeddings and report a positive effect."

However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of generated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in the source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline generation on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes generates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in untruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify the truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment of whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing untruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the untruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out untruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results demonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision data shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in automatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines."

XMI allows us to better evaluate the difficulty of translating text into the target language while controlling for the difficulty of the target-side generation component independent of the translation task. We then present the first systematic and controlled study of cross-lingual translation difficulties using modern neural translation systems.

However, explainable recommendation in dialogue is challenging since it has to handle natural language as both input and output. To tackle the challenge, this paper proposes a novel and practical task to explain evidences in recommending hotels given vague requests expressed freely in natural language. We decompose the process into two subtasks on hotel reviews: Evidence Identification and Evidence Explanation. The former predicts whether or not a sentence contains evidence that expresses why a given request is satisfied. The latter generates a recommendation sentence given a request and an evidence sentence. In order to address these subtasks, we build an Evidence-based Explanation dataset, which is the largest dataset for explaining evidences in recommending hotels for vague requests. The experimental results demonstrate that the BERT model can find evidence sentences with respect to various vague requests and that the LSTM-based model can generate recommendation sentences."

However, we also want to specify how to ask questions and improve the quality of generated questions. In this study, we explore the use of interrogative phrases as additional sources to control QG. By providing interrogative phrases, we expect that QG can generate a more reliable sequence of words subsequent to an interrogative phrase. We present a baseline sequence-to-sequence model with the attention, copy, and coverage mechanisms, and show that the simple baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance. The experiments demonstrate that interrogative phrases contribute to improving the performance of QG. In addition, we report the superiority of using interrogative phrases in human evaluation. Finally, we show that a question answering system can provide target answers more correctly when the questions are generated with interrogative phrases."

The lengths of news article headlines have precise upper bounds, dictated by the size of the display of the relevant device or interface. Therefore, controlling the length of headlines is essential when applying the task of headline generation to news production. However, because there is no corpus of headlines of multiple lengths for a given article, previous research on controlling output length in headline generation has not discussed whether the system outputs could be adequately evaluated without multiple references of different lengths. In this paper, we introduce two corpora, which are Japanese News Corpus (JNC) and JApanese MUlti-Length Headline Corpus (JAMUL), to confirm the validity of previous evaluation settings. The JNC provides common supervision data for headline generation. The JAMUL is a large-scale evaluation dataset for headlines of three different lengths composed by professional editors. We report new findings on these corpora; for example, although the longest length reference summary can appropriately evaluate the existing methods controlling output length, this evaluation setting has several problems."

In order to obtain clusters of relational patterns of good quality, we have two major challenges: the semantic representation of relational patterns and the scalability to large data. In this paper, we explore various methods for modeling the meaning of a pattern and for computing the similarity of patterns mined from huge data. In order to achieve this goal, we apply algorithms for approximate frequency counting and efficient dimension reduction to unsupervised relation extraction. The experimental results show that approximate frequency counting and dimension reduction not only speeds up similarity computation but also improves the quality of pattern vectors."

Applied to a near state-of-the-art dependency parser (Huang et al., 2012), our method improves the baseline, performs better than using cluster bit string features, and outperforms a recent neural network based parser. A further analysis shows that our framework has the effect hypothesized by Andreas and Klein (2014), namely (i) connecting unseen words to known ones, and (ii) encouraging common behaviors among invocabulary words."

For instance, the ability to generate coherent arguments during a debate can be useful when determining strengths of supporting evidence. However, with limited technologies that automatically generate arguments, the development of computational models for debates, as well as other areas, is becoming increasingly important. For this task, we focused on a promising argumentation model: the Toulmin model. The Toulmin model is both well-structured and general, and has been shown to be useful for policy debates. In this preliminary work we attempted to generate, with a given topic motion keyword or phrase, Toulmin model arguments by developing a computational model for detecting arguments spanned across multiple documents. This paper discusses our subjective results, observations, and future work."

One popular application of social media data is health surveillance, e.g., predicting the outbreak of an epidemic by recognizing diseases and symptoms from text messages posted on social media platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel task that is crucial and generic from the viewpoint of health surveillance: estimating a subject (carrier) of a disease or symptommentioned in a Japanese tweet. By designing an annotation guideline for labeling the subject of a disease/symptom in a tweet, we perform annotations on an existing corpus for public surveillance. In addition, we present a supervised approach for predicting the subject of a disease/symptom. The results of our experiments demonstrate the impact of subject identification on the effective detection of an episode of a disease/symptom. Moreover, the results suggest that our task is independent of the type of disease/symptom."

We are working to automatically detect these chronic critics to prevent the spread of bad rumors about the reputation of the entity. In social media, most comments are informal, and, there are sarcastic and incomplete contexts. This means that it is difficult for current NLP technology such as opinion mining to recognize the complaints. As an alternative approach for social media, we can assume that users who share the same opinions will link to each other. Thus, we propose a method that combines opinion mining with graph analysis for the connections between users to identify the chronic critics. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms analysis based only on opinion mining techniques."

We first discuss the necessity of numerical common sense in solving textual entailment problems. We explore two approaches for acquiring numerical common sense. Both approaches start with extracting numerical expressions and their context from the Web. One approach estimates the distribution of numbers co-occurring within a context and examines whether a given value is large, small, or normal, based on the distribution. Another approach utilizes textual patterns with which speakers explicitly expresses their judgment about the value of a numerical expression. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches."

We demonstrate the effectiveness of sibling relations in set expansion on the dataset in which instances and sibling relations are extracted from Wikipedia in a semi-automatic manner."

The most challenging part of this work is to generalize an instance of causal relation into a rule. This paper proposes a method to generalize and constrain causal rules so that the obtained rules have the high chance of applicability and reusability. In order to find a suitable constraint for a causal rule, we utilize relation instances extracted by an open-information extractor, and build a classifier to choose the most suitable constraint. We demonstrate that deverbal nouns provide a good clue for causal relations and that the proposed method can induce causal rules from deverbal noun constructions."

The proposed approach jointly models alignments, their local semantic relations, and a sentence-level semantic relation, and has hidden variables including alignment edits between sentences and their semantic relations, only requires sentences pairs annotated with sentence-level semantic relations as training data to learn appropriate alignments. In evaluation on a dataset including diverse linguistic phenomena, our proposed method achieved a competitive results on alignment prediction, and significant improvements on a sentence-level semantic relation recognition task compared to an alignment supervised model. Our analysis did not provide evidence that directly learning alignments and their labels using gold standard alignments contributed to semantic relation recognition performance and instead suggests that they can be detrimental to performance if used in a manner that prevents the learning of globally optimal alignments."

Given inverted lists retrieved for a query, the algorithm collects fewer candidate strings and prunes unlikely candidates to efficiently find strings that satisfy the constraint of the xcfx84-overlap join. We conducted experiments of approximate dictionary matching on three large-scale datasets that include person names, biomedical names, and general English words.

This paper explores several criteria for generalizing semantic roles in FrameNet: role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptors of roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and mappings from FrameNet roles to thematic roles of VerbNet. We also propose feature functions that naturally combine and weight these criteria, based on the training data. The experimental result of the role classification shows 19.16% and 7.42% improvements in error reduction rate and macro-averaged F1 score, respectively.

By combining these two approaches, experiments revealed that the proposed abbreviation generator achieved the best results for both the Chinese and English languages. Moreover, we directly apply our generator to perform a very different task from tradition, the abbreviation recognition. Experiments revealed that the proposed model worked robustly, and outperformed five out of six state-of-the-art abbreviation recognizers."

We compare three approaches to generate the bilingual lexicon: Âexact mergingÂ, Âword-based mergingÂ, and our proposed Âalignment-based mergingÂ.
