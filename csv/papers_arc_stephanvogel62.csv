We give a glimpse of the corpus, whose value surpasses the fact that it contains a high number of scientific speeches with their interpretations from English into Arabic, as it also provides rich information about the interpreters. We also discuss the difficulties, which we encountered on our way, as well as our solutions to them: our methodology for manual re-segmentation and alignment of parallel segments, the choice of annotation tool, and the annotation procedure.

This is an under-explored research direction, which can allow better parameter tuning. In this paper, we achieve this goal by selecting a subset of the available sentence pairs, which are more suitable for specific combinations of optimizers, objective functions, and evaluation measures. We demonstrate the potential of the idea with the pairwise ranking optimization (PRO) optimizer, which is known to yield too short translations. We show that the learning problem can be alleviated by tuning on a subset of the development set, selected based on sentence length. In particular, using the longest 50{\%} of the tuning sentences, we achieve two-fold tuning speedup, and improvements in BLEU score that rival those of alternatives, which fix BLEU+1{'}s smoothing instead."

On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance.

We find that MERT learns the tuning set verbosity very well, while PRO is sensitive to both the verbosity and the length of the source sentences in the tuning set; yet, overall PRO learns best from highverbosity tuning datasets. Given these dependencies, and potentially some other such as amount of reordering, number of unknown words, syntactic complexity, and evaluation measure, to mention just a few, we argue for the need of controlled evaluation scenarios, so that the selection of tuning set and optimization strategy does not overshadow scientific advances in modeling or decoding.

It is also partially due to PRO optimizing for a sentence-level score without a global view on the overall length, which introducing a bias towards short translations; we show that letting PRO optimize a corpus-level BLEU yields a perfect length. Finally, we find some residual bias due to the interaction of PRO with BLEU1: such a bias does not exist for a version of MIRA with sentence-level BLEU1. We propose several ways to fix the length problem of PRO, including smoothing the brevity penalty, scaling the effective reference length, grounding the precision component, and unclipping the brevity penalty, which yield sizable improvements in test BLEU on two Arabic-English datasets: IWSLT (0.65) and NIST (0.37)."

Even if two comparable documents have few or no parallel sentence pairs, there is still potential for parallelism in the sub-sentential level. The ability to detect these phrases creates a valuable resource, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper we explore three phrase alignment approaches to detect parallel phrase pairs embedded in comparable sentences: the standard phrase extraction algorithm, which relies on the Viterbi path; a phrase extraction approach that does not rely on the Viterbi path, but uses only lexical features; and a binary classifier that detects parallel phrase pairs when presented with a large collection of phrase pair candidates. We evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches in detecting alignments for phrase pairs that have a known alignment in comparable sentence pairs. The results show that the Non-Viterbi alignment approach outperforms the other two approaches on F1 measure."

We investigate different strategies such as density and diversity preferences as well as multistrategy methods such as modified version of DUAL and our new ensemble approach GraDUAL. These result in significant BLEU-score improvements over strong baselines when parallel training data is scarce."

We explore a way of improving phrase alignment by adding syntactic information in the form of chunks as soft constraints guided by an in-depth and detailed analysis on a hand-aligned data set. We extend a probabilistic phrase alignment model that extracts phrase pairs by optimizing phrase pair boundaries over the sentence pair [1]. The boundaries of the target phrase are chosen such that the overall sentence alignment probability is optimal. Viterbi alignment information is also added in the extended model with a view of improving phrase alignment. We extract phrase pairs using a relatively larger number of features which are discriminatively trained using a large-margin online learning algorithm, i.e., Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) and integrate it in our approach. Initial experiments show improvements in both phrase alignment and translation quality for Arabic-English on a moderate-size translation task."

We further propose different methods of combining hierarchical and syntax-based PSCFG models, by merging the grammars as well as by interpolating the translation models. Finally, we compare syntax-augmented MT, which extracts rules based on targetside syntax, to a corresponding variant based on source-side syntax, and experiment with a model extension that jointly takes source and target syntax into account."

We demonstrate the usages of both methods by selecting alignment links from manually aligned corpus and apply links generated from bilingual dictionary on unlabelled data. For the first method, we conduct controlled experiments on Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation tasks to compare the quality of word alignment, and to measure effects of two different methods in selecting alignment links from manually aligned corpus. For the second method, we experimented with moderate-scale Chinese-English translation task. The experiment results show an average improvement of 0.33 BLEU point across 8 test sets."

Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy of automatic word alignment by incorporating full or partial alignments acquired from humans. Such dedicated elicitation effort is often expensive and depends on availability of bilingual speakers for the language-pair. In this paper we study active learning query strategies to carefully identify highly uncertain or most informative alignment links that are proposed under an unsupervised word alignment model. Manual correction of such informative links can then be applied to create a labeled dataset used by a semi-supervised word alignment model. Our experiments show that using active learning leads to maximal reduction of alignment error rates with reduced human effort.

It becomes immensely difficult and costly to provide Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems for most languages due to the paucity of expert translators to provide parallel data. Even if experts are present, it appears infeasible due to the impending costs. In this paper we propose Active Crowd Translation (ACT), a new paradigm where active learning and crowd-sourcing come together to enable automatic translation for low-resource language pairs. Active learning aims at reducing cost of label acquisition by prioritizing the most informative data for annotation, while crowd-sourcing reduces cost by using the power of the crowds to make do for the lack of expensive language experts. We experiment and compare our active learning strategies with strong baselines and see significant improvements in translation quality. Similarly, our experiments with crowd-sourcing on Mechanical Turk have shown that it is possible to create parallel corpora using non-experts and with sufficient quality assurance, a translation system that is trained using this corpus approaches expert quality."

This formalism allows us to efficiently score unlabeled synchronous derivations without forgoing traditional syntactic constraints. Using this score as a feature in a log-linear model, we are able to approximate the selection of the most likely unlabeled derivation. This helps reduce fragmentation of probability across differently labeled derivations of the same translation. It also allows the importance of syntactic preferences to be learned alongside other features (e.g., the language model) and for particular labeling procedures. We show improvements in translation quality on small and medium sized Chinese-to-English translation tasks."

Except these models, we do not need explicit word alignments for phrase extraction. For each phrase pair (a block), a bilingual lexicon based score is computed to estimate the translation quality between the source and target phrase pairs; a fertility score is computed to estimate how good the lengths are matched between phrase pairs; a center distortion score is computed to estimate the relative position divergence between the phrase pairs. We presented the results and our experience in the shared tasks on French-English."

ISA extracts phrase pairs from a bilingual corpus without requiring the pre-calculated word alignment as many other phrase alignment models do. Experiments conducted within the WPT-05 shared task on statistical machine translation demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this approach.

Translating them correctly will improve many natural language processing applications. We propose a new framework to mine key phrase translations from web corpora. We submit a source phrase to a search engine as a query, then expand queries by adding the translations of topic-relevant hint words from the returned snippets. We retrieve mixed-language web pages based on the expanded queries. Finally, we extract the key phrase translation from the second-round returned web page snippets with phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features. We achieve 46% phrase translation accuracy when using top 10 returned snippets, and 80% accuracy with 165 snippets. Both results are significantly better than several existing methods."

However, in some cases, it is necessary to limit the amount of training data that can be created for or actually used by the systems. To solve that problem, we introduce a weighting scheme that tries to select more informative sentences first. This selection is based on the previously unseen n-grams the sentences contain, and it allows us to sort the sentences according to their estimated importance. After sorting, we can construct smaller training corpora, and we are able to demonstrate that systems trained on much less training data show a very competitive performance compared to baseline systems using all available training data."

The quality of the phrase alignment is crucial to the quality of the resulting translations. Here, we propose a new phrase alignment method, not based on the Viterbi path of word alignment models. Phrase alignment is viewed as a sentence splitting task. For a given spitting of the source sentence (source phrase, left segment, right segment) find a splitting for the target sentence, which optimizes the overall sentence alignment probability. Experiments on different translation tasks show that this phrase alignment method leads to highly competitive translation results."

The translation model, language model and other features were combined in a log-linear model during decoding. We present our experiments on model adaptation for new data in a different domain, as well as combining different translation hypotheses to obtain better translations.

It is used for translating sentences which have close matches in the training corpus. Given a test sentence, we first extract sentence pairs from the training corpus, whose source side is similar to the test sentence. Then, the TM system modifies the translation of the sentences by a sequence of substitution, deletion and inser- tion operations, to obtain the desired result. Statistical phrase alignment model of the SMT system is used for this purpose. The system was evaluated using a corpus of Chinese- English conversational data. For close matching sentences, the translations produced by the translation memory approach were compared with the translations of the statistical decoder."

Long phrases capture more contexts than short phrases and result in better translation qualities. On the other hand, the increasing amount of bilingual data poses serious problems for storing all possible phrases. In this paper, we describe a novel phrase- to-phrase alignment model which allows for arbitrarily long phrases and works for very large bilingual corpora. This model is very efficient in both time and space and the resulting translations are better than the state-of-the-art systems."

These models employ tf.idf to encode the weights of content and non-content words in phrase translation pairs. The translation probability is then modeled by similarity functions defined in a vector space. Two similarity functions are compared. Using these models in a statistical machine translation task shows significant improvements.

We develop a method to adapt language models using information retrieval methods. The adapted language models drastically reduce perplexity over a general language model and we can show that it is possible to improve the translation quality of a statistical machine translation using those adapted language models instead of a general language model.

Our approach assumes the availability of a small number of bi-lingual speakers of the two languages, but these need not be linguistic experts. The bi-lingual speakers create a comparatively small corpus of word aligned phrases and sentences (on the order of magnitude of a few thousand sentence pairs) using a specially designed elicitation tool. From this data, the learning module of our system automatically infers hierarchical syntactic transfer rules, which encode how syntactic constituent structures in the source language transfer to the target language. The collection of transfer rules is then used in our run-time system to translate previously unseen source language text into the target language. We describe the general principles underlying our approach, and present results from an experiment, where we developed a basic Hindi-to-English MT system over the course of two months, using extremely limited resources."

Identifying translingual equivalence of named entities (NE) can significantly contribute to multilingual natural language processing, such as crosslingual information retrieval, crosslingual information extraction and statistical machine translation. In this paper we present an integrated approach to extract NE translingual equivalence from a parallel Chinese-English corpus.Starting from a bilingual corpus where NEs are automatically tagged for each language, NE pairs are aligned in order to minimize the overall multi-feature alignment cost. An NE transliteration model is presented and iteratively trained using named entity pairs extracted from a bilingual dictionary. The transliteration cost, combined with the named entity tagging cost and word-based translation cost, constitute the multi-feature alignment cost. These features are derived from several information sources using unsupervised and partly supervised methods. A greedy search algorithm is applied to minimize the alignment cost. Experiments show that the proposed approach extracts NE translingual equivalence with 81% F-score and improves the translation score from 7.68 to 7.74."

We present a technique that begins with improved IBM models to create phrase level knowledge sources that effectively represent local as well as global phrasal context. Our method is robust to noisy alignments at both the sentence and corpus level, delivering high quality phrase level translation pairs that contribute to significant improvements in translation quality (as measured by the BLEU metric) over word based lexica as well as a competing alignment based method."

The statistical translation uses two sources of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a standard bigram model. For the translation model, the alignment probabilities are made dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. Thus, the approach amounts to a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. Under the assumption that the alignment is monotone with respect to the word order in both languages, an efficient search strategy for translation can be formulated. The details of the search algorithm are described. Experiments on the EuTrans corpus produced a word error rate of 5.1%."
