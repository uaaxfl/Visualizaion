This paper introduces a novel method of temporal analysis for SVF tasks utilizing time intervals and applies it to a corpus of elderly Swedish subjects (mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and healthy controls). A general decline in word count and lexical frequency over the course of the task is revealed, as well as an increase in word transition times. Persons with subjective cognitive impairment had a higher word count during the last intervals, but produced words of the same lexical frequencies. Persons with MCI had a steeper decline in both word count and lexical frequencies during the third interval. Additional correlations with neuropsychological scores suggest these findings are linked to a person{'}s overall vocabulary size and processing speed, respectively. Classification results improved when adding the novel features (AUC=0.72), supporting their diagnostic value."

Here, we compare several methods of domain adaptation to augment a small French dataset of picture descriptions (n = 57) with a much larger English dataset (n = 550), for the task of automatically distinguishing participants with dementia from controls. The first challenge is to identify a set of features that transfer across languages; in addition to previously used features based on information units, we introduce a new set of features to model the order in which information units are produced by dementia patients and controls. These concept-based language model features improve classification performance in both English and French separately, and the best result (AUC = 0.89) is achieved using the multilingual training set with a combination of information and language model features."

By applying macroanalytic techniques we are aiming to investigate how women enter literature and particularly which functions do they assume, their working patterns and if we can spot differences in how often male and female characters are mentioned with various types of occupational titles (vocation) in Swedish literary texts. Modern historiography, and especially feminist and womenxe2x80x99s history has emphasized a relative invisibility of womenxe2x80x99s work and women workers. The reasons to this are manifold, and the extent, the margin of error in terms of womenxe2x80x99s work activities is of course hard to assess. Therefore, vocation identification can be used as an indicator for such exploration and we present a hybrid system for automatic annotation of vocational signals in 19th century Swedish prose fiction. Beside vocations, the system also assigns gender (male, female or unknown) to the vocation words, a prerequisite for the goals of the study and future in-depth explorations of the corpora."

In this paper, wen study the search logs of a public Swedish health portal to address the questions if health information seeking differs from other types of Internet search and if there is a potential for utilizing network analysis methods in combination with semantic annotation to gain insights into search behaviors. Using a semantic-based method and a graph-based analysis of word cooccurrences in queries, we show there is an overlap among the results indicating a potential role of these types of methods to gain insights and facilitate improved information search. In addition we show that samples, windows of a month, of search logs may be sufficient to obtain similar results as using larger windows. We also show that medical queries share the samen structural properties found for other types of information searches, thereby indicating an ability to reuse existing analysis methods for this type of search data."

We analyzed a small subset of a large literary collection, the Swedish Literature Bank, by focusing on the extraction of persons' names, their gender and their normalized, linked form, including mentions of theistic beings (e.g., Gods' names and mythological figures), and examined their appearance over the course of the novel. A case study based on 13 novels, from the aforementioned collection, shows a number of interesting applications of visual analytics methods to literature problems, where named entities can play a prominent role, demonstrating the advantage of visual literature analysis.

In addition, we evaluate two methods to make the role label classifier more robust: cross-frame generalization and cluster-based features. Although the small amount of training data limits the performance achievable at the moment, we reach promising results. In particular, the classifier that extracts the boundaries of arguments works well for new frames, which suggests that it already at this stage can be useful in a semi-automatic setting."
W11-4206,"Reducing Complexity in Parsing Scientific Medical Data, a Diabetes Case Study",2011,20,0,1,1,24566,dimitrios kokkinakis,Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing,0,The aim of this study is to assemble and deploy various NLP components and resources in order to parse scientific medical text data and evaluate the degree in which these resources contribute to the overall parsing performance. With parsing we limit our efforts to the identification of unrestricted noun phrases with full phrase structure and investigate the effects of using layers of semantic annotations prior to parsing. Scientific medical texts exhibit complex linguistic structure but also regularities that can be captured by pre-processing the texts with specialized semantically-aware tools. Our results show evidence of improved performance while the complexity of parsing is reduced. Parsed scientific texts and inferred syntactic information can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of higher-level tasks such as information extraction and enhance the acquisition of semantic relations and events.

An important aspect of language technology is the research infrastructure known by the acronym BLARK (Basic LAnguage Resource Kit). A BLARK as normally presented in the literature arguably reflects a modern standard language, which is topic- and genre-neutral, thus abstracting away from all kinds of language variation. We argue that this notion could fruitfully be extended along any of the three axes implicit in this characterization (the social, the topical and the temporal), in our case the temporal axis, towards a diachronic BLARK for Swedish, which can be used to develop e-science tools in support of historical studies."

Our work has been developed across two dimensions. Initially a Swedish electronic text collection of scientific medical documents has been collected and processed to a uniform format. Secondly, a term processing activity has been taken place. In the first phase of this activity, various SNOMED CT subsets have been mapped to the text collection for evaluating the validity and reliability of the translated terms. In parallel, a large number of term candidates have been extracted from the corpus in order to examine the coverage of SNOMED CT. Term candidates that are currently not included in the Swedish SNOMED CT can be either parts of compounds, parts of potential multiword terms, terms that are not yet been translated or potentially new candidates. In order to achieve these goals a number of automatic term recognition algorithms have been applied to the corpus. The results of the later process is to be reviewed by domain experts (relevant to the subsets extracted) through a relevant interface who can decide whether a new set of terms can be incorporated in the Swedish translation of SNOMED CT or not."

There are a number of approaches to the identification described in the literature, particularly within the biomedical domain, but none of those addresses the variation and complexity exhibited in a language other than English. This is realized by the fact that we can have a mixture of two languages in the same document and/or sentence, i.e. Swedish and English; that Swedish is a compound language that significantly deteriorates the performance of previous approaches (without adaptations) and, most importantly, the fact that there is a large variation of possible acronym-definition permutations realized in the analysed corpora, a variation that is usually ignored in previous studies."
