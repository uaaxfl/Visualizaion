In this research, a general-purpose semantic model is used to double annotate a batch of {\$}500{\$} sentences that were manually selected by the researchers from the CORD-19 corpus. Afterwards, a baseline text-mining pipeline is designed and evaluated via a large batch of {\$}100,959{\$} sentences. We present a qualitative analysis of the most interesting facts automatically extracted and highlight possible future lines of development. The preliminary results show that general-purpose semantic models are a useful tool for discovering fine-grained knowledge in large corpora of scientific documents."

In contrast with existing AutoML approaches, our contribution can automatically build machine learning pipelines that combine techniques and algorithms from different frameworks, including shallow classifiers, natural language processing tools, and neural networks. We define the heterogeneous AutoML optimization problem as the search for the best sequence of algorithms that transforms specific input data into the desired output. This provides a novel theoretical and practical approach to AutoML. Our proposal is experimentally evaluated in diverse machine learning problems and compared with alternative approaches, showing that it is competitive with other AutoML alternatives in standard benchmarks. Furthermore, it can be applied to novel scenarios, such as several NLP tasks, where existing alternatives cannot be directly deployed. The system is freely available and includes in-built compatibility with a large number of popular machine learning frameworks, which makes our approach useful for solving practical problems with relative ease and effort."

The SNN architecture is defined in terms of the concepts and relations present in a knowledge base. Based on this architecture, a training procedure is developed. Finally, an experimental setup is presented to illustrate the behaviour and performance of a SNN for a specific NLP problem, in this case, opinion mining for the classification of movie reviews."

Also, the transitions between states have been taken into account. These values were used to assign the predicted polarity when a pattern was found in a sentence; if a pattern cannot be applied, the probabilities of the polarities between states were computed in order to predict the right polarity.

We induce, for each term, two real scores that indicate its use in positive and negative contexts in the domain of interest. The aspect term polarity classification is carried out in two phases: opinion words extraction and polarity classification. The opinion words related with an aspect are obtained using dependency relations. These relations are provided by the Stanford Parser 1 . Finally, the polarity of the feature, in a given review, is determined from the positive and negative scores of each word related to it. The results obtained by our approach are encouraging if we consider that the construction of the polarity lexicon is performed fully automatically."

The results reported in this paper show that supervised and unsupervised methods working in parallel, and a simple sequence of preferences when comparing the answers of such methods, is a feasible method. . . The whole system is, in fact, a cascade of decisions of what label to assign to a concrete instance based on the agreement of pairs of systems, when it is possible, or selecting the available answer from one of them. In this way, supervised are preferred to unsupervised methods, but these last ones are able to tag such words that not have available training data."

In the present work we propose a method for the enrichment of EuroWordNet with syntagmatic information, by means of the WSD process itself. We consider that an ambiguous occurrence drastically reduces its ambiguity when considered together with the words it establishes syntactic relations in the sentence: the claim of xe2x80x9cquasi one sense per syntactic relationxe2x80x9d. On this hypothesis, we obtain sense-tagged syntactic patterns for an ambiguous word intensively using the corpus, with the help of EWN and of associated WSD algorithms. For an occurrence disambiguation, we also consider the whole sentential context where we apply the same WSD algorithms, and combine the sense proposals from the syntactic patterns with the ones from the sentential context. We evaluate the hole WSD method on the nouns in the Spanish Senseval-2 exercise and also the utility of the syntactic patterns for the sense assignment. The annotated patterns we obtain in the WSD process are incorporated into EWN, associated to the synset of the assigned sense. As the syntactic pattern repeat themselves in the text, if sense-tagged, they are a valuable information for future WSD tasks."

The methods are, respectively, Specification Marks and Maximum Entropy probability models. So, we can say that this is a hybrid system which joins an unsupervised method with a supervised method. The whole system has been used in lexical sample english task and lexical sample spanish task."
