This paper investigates the effect of decontextualised source texts on behaviour by comparing post-editing of sequentially ordered sentences with shuffled sentences from two different texts. The findings suggest that there is little or no effect of the decontextualised source texts on behaviour."

We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of xe2x80x9cbinningxe2x80x9d sentences (to be translated) in xe2x80x9ceasyxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cmediumxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9chardxe2x80x9d categories as per their predicted TDI.

This can also provide a way of monitoring progress of second language learners."

It is available open source and integrates with multiple MT systems. The goal of the CASMACAT project1 is to develop an advanced computer aided translation workbench. At the mid-point of the 3-year project, we release this tool as open source software. It already includes a wide range of novel advanced types of assistance and other functionalities that do not exist together in any other computer aided translation tool. The CASMACAT is working in close collaboration with the MATECAT project2, which also has the goal of developing a new open source webbased computer aided translation tool, and focuses mainly on post-editing machine translation, adaptation methods, and ease of use that make such a tool suitable for professional users. Through this combined effort, we hope to kickstart broader research into computer aided translation methods, facilitating diverse translation process studies, and reach volunteer and professional translators without advanced technical skills. The tool is developed as a web-based platform using HTML5 and Javascript in the Browser and PHP in the backend, supported by a CAT and MT server that run as independent process (both implemented in Python but integrating tools written in various other programming languages). http://www.casmacat.eu/ http://www.matecat.com/ 1 Related Work There is increasing evidence for productivity gains of professional translators when they post-edit machine translation output. For instance, Plitt and Masselot (2010) compare post-editing machine translation against unassisted translation in a web-based tool for a number of language pairs, showing productivity gains of up to 80%. Skadixc5x86s et al. (2011) show a 30 percent increase for English-Latvian translation with a slight but acceptable degradation in quality. Federico et al. (2012) assess the benefit of offering machine translation output in addition to translation memory matches (marked as such) in a realistic work environment for translators working on legal and information technology documents. They observe productivity gains of 20-50%, roughly independent from the original translator speed and segment length, but with different results for different language pairs and domains. Moreover, Pouliquen et al. (2011) show that, aided by machine translation, non-professional post-editors may be able to create high-quality translations, comparable to a professional translation agency. So far, usage of machine translation technology has concentrated on human-computer interaction involving the human translator as a post-editor, but rarely involves the human translator influencing the decisions of the machine translation system. Recent efforts on building interactive machine translation systems include work by Langlais et al. (2000) and Barrachina et al. (2009). Both studies develop research systems looking into a tighter integration of human translators in MT processes by developing a prediction model that interactively suggests translations to the human translator as he or she types. Related work displays several word and phrase translation choices to human translators (Koehn, 2010). Figure 1: View for uploading new documents"

Systematic errors are frequent and add a lot of noise to the data. It also takes a lot of time and effort to manually correct such disparities. In this paper, we propose and validate a heuristic-based technique to reduce such errors associated with gaze fixations by shifting them to their true locations. This technique is exclusively applicable for reading tasks where the visual objects (characters) are placed on a grid in a sequential manner; which is often the case in psycholinguistic studies."

This paper describes a number of methods to train statistical feature functions from some of the vectorÂs components. The feature functions are trained off-line on different types of text and their log-linear combination is then used to retrieve the best translation paths in the graph. We compare two language modelling toolkits, the CMU and the SRI toolkit and arrive at three results: 1) models of lemma-based feature functions produce better results than token-based models, 2) adding PoS-tag feature function to the lemma models improves the output and 3) weights for lexical translations are suited if the training material is similar to the texts to be translated."

The set of in- vertible translation examples is used in the Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system EDGAR for translation. Invertible bilin- gual grammars eliminate translation ambiguities such that each source language parse tree maps into only one target language string.

It is shown that i) best translation results are achieved for the EBMT system when using a bilingual lexicon to sup- port the alignment process ii) TMs and EBMT-systems can be linked in a dynamical sequential manner and iii) the combined translation of TMs and EBMT is in any case better than each of the single system.

Translation templates determine the word order of the target language and the type of phrases (e.g. noun phrase, prepositional phase, ...) to be generated in the target language. An induction mechanism generalizes translation templates from translation examples. The paper outlines the basic idea underlying the EBMT system and investigates the possibilities and limits of the translation template induction process."
1999.mtsummit-1.92,Linking translation memories with example-based machine translation,1999,1,27,1,1,5265,michael carl,Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit VII,0,"The paper reports on experiments which compare the translation outcome of three corpus-based MT systems, a string-based translation memory (STM), a lexeme-based translation memory (LTM) and the example-based machine translation (EBMT) system EDGAR. We use a fully automatic evaluation method to compare the outcome of each MT system and discuss the results. We investigate the benefits for the linkage of different MT strategies such as TMsystems and EBMT systems."
W98-1230,A Constructivist Approach to Machine Translation,1998,15,38,1,1,5265,michael carl,New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,0,"Constructivist cognitive theories conceptualize memory as a dynamic process which is directly linked to perception, memories and conclusion/induction (cf. [Sch91]). From this point of view, memory serves to establish structures that are relevant to the cognitive system in the present context of action. The function of memory is thus to participate in coherent behavior which makes survival of the acting cognitive system easier (or possible). Memories are similar to perceptions: they are perceptions without an object. Perception on the other hand is an activity (and not a passive process) that is driven by the memory."
W98-1231,Shallow Post Morphological Processing with {KURD},1998,3,16,1,1,5265,michael carl,New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,0,"In this paper we describe a constraint based formalism that manipulates sequences of morphological analyses in order to Kill, Unify, Replace or Delete parts of the structure. We compare the formalism to a similar approach (CGP) and describe two applications."
