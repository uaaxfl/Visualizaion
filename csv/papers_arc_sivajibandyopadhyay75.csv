In contrast, similar tools for Indian Languages are scarce. This is because, state-of-the-art pre-processing tools like POS tagger, shallow parsers, etc., are not readily available for Indian languages. Although, such working tools for Indian languages, like Hindi and Bengali, that are spoken by the majority of the population, are available, finding the same for less spoken languages like, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam, is difficult. Moreover, due to the advent of social media, the multi-lingual population of India, who are comfortable with both English ad their regional language, prefer to communicate by mixing both languages. This gives rise to massive code-mixed content and automatically annotating them with their respective sentiment labels becomes a challenging task. In this work, we take up a similar challenge of developing a sentiment analysis model that can work with English-Tamil code-mixed data. The proposed work tries to solve this by using bi-directional LSTMs along with language tagging. Other traditional methods, based on classical machine learning algorithms have also been discussed in the literature, and they also act as the baseline systems to which we will compare our Neural Network based model. The performance of the developed algorithm, based on Neural Network architecture, garnered precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.59, 0.66, and 0.58 respectively."

A Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tool is used to record the time, keystroke and other indicators to measure PE effort in terms of temporal and technical effort. A positive correlation between the technical effort and the number of function words is seen for English-Manipuri and English-Mizo but a negative correlation between the technical effort and the number of noun words for English-Mizo. However, average time spent per token in PE English-Mizo text is negatively correlated with the temporal effort. The main reason for these results are due to (i) English and Mizo using the same script, while Manipuri uses a different script and (ii) the agglutinative nature of Manipuri. Further, we check the impact of training a MT system in an incremental approach, by including the post-edited dataset as additional training data.

The problem of reordering between distant languages has been approached with prior reordering of the source text at chunk level to simulate the target language ordering. Prior reordering of the source chunks is performed in the present work by following the target word order suggested by word alignment. The testset is reordered using monolingual MT trained on source and reordered source. This approach of prior reordering of the source chunks was compared with pre-ordering of source words based on word alignments and the traditional approach of prior source reordering based on language-pair specific reordering rules. The effects of these reordering approaches were studied on an English--Bengali translation task, a language pair with different word order. From the experimental results it was found that word alignment based reordering of the source chunks is more effective than the other reordering approaches, and it produces statistically significant improvements over the baseline system on BLEU.

Initially, events and event actors are identified from English and Bengali parallel corpus. For events and event actor identification in English we proposed a hybrid technique and it was carried out within the TimeML framework. Events in Bengali are identified based on the concept of complex predicate structures. There can be one-to-one and one-to-many mappings between English and Bengali events and event actors. We preprocess the parallel corpus by single tokenizing the multiword events and event-actors which reflects some significant gain on the PB-SMT system. We represent a hybrid alignment approach of events and event-actors in both English-Bengali training corpus by defining a rule based aligner and a statistical hybrid aligner. The rule base aligner assumes a heuristic that the sequence of events and event actors on the source (English) side are also maintained in the target (Bengali) side. The performance of PB-SMT system could vary depending on the number of events and event-actors that are identified in the parallel training data.

As an intimate relationship presents between music and human emotions, we often choose to listen a song that suits our mood at that instant. Thus, the automatic methods are needed to classify music by moods even from the uploaded music files in social networks. However, several studies on Music Information Retrieval (MIR) have been carried out in recent decades. In the present task, we have built a system for classifying moods of Hindi songs using different audio related features like rhythm, timber and intensity. Our dataset is composed of 230 Hindi music clips of 30 seconds that consist of five mood clusters. We have achieved an average accuracy of 51.56% for music mood classification on the above data."
W13-2814,A Hybrid Word Alignment Model for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation,2013,25,9,3,1,13776,santanu pal,Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation,0,This paper proposes a hybrid word alignment model for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine translation (PB-SMT). The proposed hybrid alignment model provides most informative alignment links which are offered by both unsupervised and semi-supervised word alignment models. Two unsupervised word alignment models (GIZA and Berkeley aligner) and a rule based aligner are combined together. The rule based aligner only aligns named entities (NEs) and chunks. The NEs are aligned through transliteration using a joint source-channel model. Chunks are aligned employing a bootstrapping approach by translating the source chunks into the target language using a baseline PB-SMT system and subsequently validating the target chunks using a fuzzy matching technique against the target corpus. All the experiments are carried out after single-tokenizing the multi-word NEs. Our best system provided significant improvements over the baseline as measured by BLEU.

We adopt the Potts model for the probability modeling of the lexical network. The lexical network has been constructed by connecting each pair of words in which one of the two words appears in the gloss of the other. Starting with a small number of emotional seed words, the emotional categories of other words have been determined. With manual checking of top 200 words from each class an average precision of 85.41% has been achieved."

In this paper the automatic alignments of different kind of chunks have been studied that boosts up the word alignment as well as the machine translation quality. Single-tokenization of Noun-noun MWEs, phrasal preposition (source side only) and reduplicated phrases (target side only) and the alignment of named entities and complex predicates provide the best SMT model for bootstrapping. Automatic bootstrapping on the alignment of various chunks makes significant gains over the previous best English-Bengali PB-SMT system. The source chunks are translated into the target language using the PB-SMT system and the translated chunks are compared with the original target chunk. The aligned chunks increase the size of the parallel corpus. The processes are run in a bootstrapping manner until all the source chunks have been aligned with the target chunks or no new chunk alignment is identified by the bootstrapping process.

In the English-Manipuri statistical machine translation system, the role of the suffixes and dependency relations on the source side and case markers on the target side are identified as important translation factors. A parallel corpus of 10350 sentences from news domain is used for training and the system is tested with 500 sentences. Using the proposed translation factors, the output of the translation quality is improved as indicated by baseline BLEU score of 13.045 and factored BLEU score of 16.873 respectively. Similarly, for the Manipuri English system, the role of case markers and POS tags information at the source side and suffixes and dependency relations at the target side are identified as useful translation factors. The case markers and suffixes are not only responsible to determine the word classes but also to determine the dependency relations. Using these translation factors, the output of the translation quality is improved as indicated by baseline BLEU score of 13.452 and factored BLEU score of 17.573 respectively. Further, the subjective evaluation indicates the improvement in the fluency and adequacy of both the factored SMT outputs over the respective baseline systems."

In this paper, we show how single-tokenization of two types of multi-word expressions (MWE), namely named entities (NE) and compound verbs, as well as their prior alignment can boost the performance of PB-SMT. Single-tokenization of compound verbs and named entities (NE) provides significant gains over the baseline PB-SMT system. Automatic alignment of NEs substantially improves the overall MT performance, and thereby the word alignment quality indirectly. For establishing NE alignments, we transliterate source NEs into the target language and then compare them with the target NEs. Target language NEs are first converted into a canonical form before the comparison takes place. Our best system achieves statistically significant improvements (4.59 BLEU points absolute, 52.5% relative improvement) on an Englishxe2x80x94Bangla translation task."

But no such information could be retrieved from available lexicon resources. SemanticNet is the attempt to capture wide range of context dependent semantic inference among various themes which human beings perceive in their pragmatic knowledge, learned by day to day cognitive interactions with the surrounding physical world. SemanticNet holds human pragmatics with twenty well established semantic relations for every pair of lexemes. As every pair of relations cannot be defined by fixed number of certain semantic relation labels thus additionally contextual semantic affinity inference in SemanticNet could be calculated by network distance and represented as a probabilistic score.

The system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of features that are helpful in predicting the various named entity (NE) classes. A portion of the partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus, developed from the archive of a leading Bengali newspaper available in the web, has been used to develop the system. The training set consists of 150K words and has been manually annotated with a NE tagset of seventeen tags. Experimental results of the 10-fold cross validation test show the effectiveness of the proposed CRF based NER system with an overall average Recall, Precision and F-Score values of 93.8%, 87.8% and 90.7%, respectively."
I08-2095,Generation of Referring Expression Using Prefix Tree Structure,2008,5,1,2,0,47770,sibabrata paladhi,Proceedings of the Third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Volume-{II},0,"This paper presents a Prefix Tree (Trie) based model for Generation of Referring Expression (GRE). The existing algorithms in GRE lie in two extremities. Incremental algorithm is simple and speedy but less expressive in nature whereas others are complex and exhaustive but more expressive in nature. Our prefix tree based model not only incorporates all relevant features of GRE (like describing set, generating Boolean and context sensitive description etc.) but also try to attain simplicity and speed properties of Incremental algorithm. Thus this model provides a simple and linguistically rich approach to GRE."

The algorithm tries to disambiguate nouns, verbs and adjectives. The algorithm relies on the POS-sense tagged synset glosses provided by the Extended WordNet. The basic unit of disambiguation of our algorithm is the entire sentence under consideration. It takes a global approach where all the words in the target sentence are simultaneously disambiguated. The context includes previous and next sentence. The system assigns the default WordNet first sense to a word when the algorithm fails to predict the sense of the word. The system produces a precision and recall of .402 on the SemEval-2007 English All-Words test data."
W06-2113,Handling of Prepositions in {E}nglish to {B}engali Machine Translation,2006,20,22,2,1,1243,sudip naskar,Proceedings of the Third {ACL}-{SIGSEM} Workshop on Prepositions,0,"The present study focuses on the lexical meanings of prepositions rather than on the thematic meanings because it is intended for use in an English-Bengali machine translation (MT) system, where the meaning of a lexical unit must be preserved in the target language, even though it may take a different syntactic form in the source and target languages. Bengali is the fifth language in the world in terms of the number of native speakers and is an important language in India. There is no concept of preposition in Bengali. English prepositions are translated to Bengali by attaching appropriate inflections to the head noun of the prepositional phrase (PP), i.e., the object of the preposition. The choice of the inflection depends on the spelling pattern of the translated Bengali head noun. Further postpositional words may also appear in the Bengali translation for some prepositions. The choice of the appropriate post-positional word depends on the WordNet synset information of the head noun. Idiomatic or metaphoric PPs are translated into Bengali by looking into a bilingual example base. The analysis presented here is general and applicable for translation from English to many other Indo-Aryan languages that handle prepositions using inflections and postpositions."
W06-1908,Dialogue based Question Answering System in {T}elugu,2006,9,13,3,0,49736,rami reddy,Proceedings of the Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - {MLQA} {`}06,0,"A dialogue based Question Answering (QA) system for Railway information in Telugu has been described. Telugu is an important language in India belonging to the Dravidian family. The main component of our QA system is the Dialogue Manager (DM), to handle the dialogues between user and system. It is necessary in generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, resolving Anaphora and Co-reference problems. Besides, different modules have been developed for processing the query and its translation into formal database query language statement(s). Based on the result from the database, a natural language answer is generated. The empirical results obtained on the current system are encouraging. Testing with a set of questions in Railway domain, the QA system showed 96.34% of precision and 83.96% of dialogue success rate. Such a question answering system can be effectively utilized when integrated with a speech input and speech output system."
P06-2025,A Modified Joint Source-Channel Model for Transliteration,2006,12,52,3,1,363,asif ekbal,Proceedings of the {COLING}/{ACL} 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions,0,Most machine transliteration systems transliterate out of vocabulary (OOV) words through intermediate phonemic mapping. A framework has been presented that allows direct orthographical mapping between two languages that are of different origins employing different alphabet sets. A modified joint source-channel model along with a number of alternatives have been proposed. Aligned transliteration units along with their context are automatically derived from a bilingual training corpus to generate the collocational statistics. The transliteration units in Bengali words take the pattern CM where C represents a vowel or a consonant or a conjunct and M represents the vowel modifier or matra. The English transliteration units are of the form C*V* where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. A Bengali-English machine transliteration system has been developed based on the proposed models. The system has been trained to transliterate person names from Bengali to English. It uses the linguistic knowledge of possible conjuncts and diphthongs in Bengali and their equivalents in English. The system has been evaluated and it has been observed that the modified joint source-channel model performs best with a Word Agreement Ratio of 69.3% and a Transliteration Unit Agreement Ratio of 89.8%.

The paper focuses on the structure of the noun, verb and prepositional phrases in English and how these phrases are realized in Bengali. This study has an effect on the design of the phrasal Example Base and recombination rules for the target language phrases."
2005.mtsummit-posters.21,Use of Machine Translation in {I}ndia: Current Status,2005,-1,-1,2,1,1243,sudip naskar,Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit X: Posters,0,A survey of the machine translation systems that have been developed in India for translation from English to Indian languages and among Indian languages reveals that the MT softwares are used in field testing or are available as web translation service. These systems are also used for teaching machine translation to the students and researchers. Most of these systems are in the English-Hindi or Indian language-Indian language domain. The translation domains are mostly government documents/reports and news stories. There are a number of other MT systems that are at their various phases of development and have been demonstrated at various forums. Many of these systems cover other Indian languages beside Hindi.
2005.mtsummit-ebmt.16,A Semantics-based {E}nglish-{B}engali {EBMT} System for Translating News Headlines,2005,-1,-1,2,0,51233,diganta saha,Workshop on example-based machine translation,0,"The paper reports an Example based Machine Translation System for translating News Headlines from English to Bengali. The input headline is initially searched in the Direct Example Base. If it cannot be found, the input headline is tagged and the tagged headline is searched in the Generalized Tagged Example Base. If a match is obtained, the tagged headline in Bengali is retrieved from the example base, the output Bengali headline is generated after retrieving the Bengali equivalents of the English words from appropriate dictionaries and then applying relevant synthesis rules for generating the Bengali surface level words. If some named entities and acronyms are not present in the dictionary, transliteration scheme is applied for obtaining the Bengali equivalent. If a match is not found, the tagged input headline is analysed to identify the constituent phrase(s). The target translation is generated using English-Bengali phrasal example base, appropriate dictionaries and a set of heuristics for Bengali phrase reordering. If the headline still cannot be translated using example base strategy, a heuristic translation strategy will be applied. Any new input tagged headline along with its translation by the user will be inserted in the tagged Example base after generalization."
