In this paper, we present a method for rapidly constructing a tweet dataset containing a wide range of country-level Arabic dialects {---}covering 18 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Our method relies on applying multiple filters to identify users who belong to different countries based on their account descriptions and to eliminate tweets that either write mainly in Modern Standard Arabic or mostly use vulgar language. The resultant dataset contains 540k tweets from 2,525 users who are evenly distributed across 18 Arab countries. Using intrinsic evaluation, we show that the labels of a set of randomly selected tweets are 91.5{\%} accurate. For extrinsic evaluation, we are able to build effective country level dialect identification on tweets with a macro-averaged F1-score of 60.6{\%} across 18 classes."

Recently, OpenAI has developed a machine learning system called GPT-2 for Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2, which can produce deepfake texts. It can generate blocks of text based on brief writing prompts that look like they were written by humans, facilitating the spread false or auto-generated text. In line with this progress, and in order to counteract potential dangers, several methods have been proposed for detecting text written by these language models. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning based model that will be able to detect if an Arabic sentence is written by humans or automatically generated by bots. Our dataset is based on tweets from a previous work, which we have crawled and extended using the Twitter API. We used GPT2-Small-Arabic to generate fake Arabic Sentences. For evaluation, we compared different recurrent neural network (RNN) word embeddings based baseline models, namely: LSTM, BI-LSTM, GRU and BI-GRU, with a transformer-based model. Our new transfer-learning model has obtained an accuracy up to 98{\%}. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study where ARABERT and GPT2 were combined to detect and classify the Arabic auto-generated texts."

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce and make publicly available a new dialectal Arabic news comment dataset, collected from multiple social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. We follow two-step crowd-annotator selection criteria for low-representative language annotation task in a crowdsourcing platform. Furthermore, we analyze the distinctive lexical content along with the use of emojis in offensive comments.

In this work, we present a unified character level sequence-to-sequence deep learning model that recovers both types of diacritics without the use of explicit feature engineering. Specifically, we employ a standard neural machine translation setup on overlapping windows of words (broken down into characters), and then we use voting to select the most likely diacritized form of a word.

Our findings suggest that to have consistent and cost effective MT evaluations, it is better to use monolinguals with only target language information."

Our models maximize the cross entropy by regularizing the loss function with respect to in-domain model. Domain adaptation is carried out by assigning higher weight to out-domain sequences that are similar to the in-domain data. In our alternative model we take a more restrictive approach by additionally penalizing sequences similar to the outdomain data. Our models achieve better perplexities than the baseline NNJM models and give improvements of up to 0.5 and 0.6 BLEU points in Arabic-to-English and English-to-German language pairs, on a standard task of translating TED talks."

The system performs: correction of common spelling errors pertaining to different forms of alef, ta marbouta and ha, and alef maqsoura and ya; context sensitive word segmentation into underlying clitics, POS tagging, and gender and number tagging of nouns and adjectives. We introduce the use of stem templates as a feature to improve POS tagging by 0.5{\textbackslash}{\%} and to help ascertain the gender and number of nouns and adjectives. For gender and number tagging, we report accuracies that are significantly higher on previously unseen words compared to a state-of-the-art system."

This corpus includes both resource-rich languages such as English and Arabic, and resource-poor languages such as Hindi and Thai. In this paper, we describe the gathering, validation, and preprocessing of a large collection of parallel, community-generated subtitles. Furthermore, we describe the methodology used to prepare the data for Machine Translation tasks. Additionally, we provide a document-level, jointly aligned development and test sets for 14 language pairs, designed for tuning and testing Machine Translation systems. We provide baseline results for these tasks, and highlight some of the challenges we face when building machine translation systems for educational content."

We crawl a multilingual collection community generated subtitles, and present the results of processing the Arabic{--}English portion of the data, which yields a parallel corpus of about 2.6M Arabic and 3.9M English words. We explore different approaches to align the segments, and extrinsically evaluate the resulting parallel corpus on the standard TED-talks tst-2010. We observe that the data can be successfully used for this task, and also observe an absolute improvement of 1.6 BLEU when it is used in combination with TED data. Finally, we analyze some of the specific challenges when translating the educational content."

The Semitic languages present unique challenges to IR for a number of reasons, so we set out to answer the question of whether cross-language IR for Semitic languages can be boosted by manipulation of the training data (which, in our framework, includes multilingual parallel text, some of which is morphologically analyzed). We attempted three measures to achieve this: first, the inclusion of genetically related (i.e., other Semitic) languages in the training data; second, the inclusion of non-related languages sharing the same script, and third, the inclusion of morphological analysis for Semitic languages. We find that language relatedness is a definite factor in boosting IR precision; script similarity can probably be ruled out as a factor; and morphological analysis can be helpful, but xe2x80x93 perhaps paradoxically xe2x80x93 not necessarily to the languages which are subjected to morphological analysis."

LMSA overcomes some of the shortcomings of related previous approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LMSA has an important theoretical advantage over LSA: it combines well-known techniques in a novel way to break the terms of LSA down into units which correspond more closely to morphemes. Thus, it has a particular appeal for use with morphologically complex languages such as Arabic. We show through empirical results that the theoretical advantages of LMSA can translate into significant gains in precision in multilingual information retrieval tests. These gains are not matched either when a standard stemmer is used with LSA, or when terms are indiscriminately broken down into n-grams."

Most, if not all, previous work which follows this approach has focused on bilingual retrieval; two examples involve the use of FrenchEnglish or English-Greek parallel corpora. Our extension to the approach is xe2x80x98massively parallelxe2x80x99 in two senses, one linguistic and the other computational. First, we make use of a parallel aligned corpus consisting of almost 50 parallel translations in over 30 distinct languages, each in over 30,000 documents. Given the size of this dataset, a xe2x80x98massively parallelxe2x80x99 approach was also necessitated in the more usual computational sense. Our results indicate that, far from adding more noise, more linguistic parallelism is better when it comes to cross-language retrieval precision, in addition to the self-evident benefit that CLIR can be performed on more languages."
