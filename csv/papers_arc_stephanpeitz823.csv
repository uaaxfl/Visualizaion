However, on the closely related task of word alignment, traditional statistical word alignment models often remain the go-to solution. In this paper, we present an approach to train a Transformer model to produce both accurate translations and alignments. We extract discrete alignments from the attention probabilities learnt during regular neural machine translation model training and leverage them in a multi-task framework to optimize towards translation and alignment objectives. We demonstrate that our approach produces competitive results compared to GIZA++ trained IBM alignment models without sacrificing translation accuracy and outperforms previous attempts on Transformer model based word alignment. Finally, by incorporating IBM model alignments into our multi-task training, we report significantly better alignment accuracies compared to GIZA++ on three publicly available data sets."
W15-3060,Local System Voting Feature for Machine Translation System Combination,2015,24,5,3,1,3519,markus freitag,Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation,0,"In this paper, we enhance the traditional confusion network system combination approach with an additional model trained by a neural network. This work is motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system voting models only assign each input system a global weight which is responsible for the global impact of each input system on all translations. This prevents individual systems with low system weights from having influence on the system combination output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further, words which have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance of being present in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by a neural network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorial occurrences of the different system outputs. This gives system combination the option to prefer other systems at different word positions even for the same sentence."

We propose to use the RPROP algorithm for optimizing a maximum expected BLEU objective and experimentally compare it to several other updating schemes. It proves to be more efficient and effective than the previously proposed growth transformation technique and also yields better results than stochastic gradient descent and AdaGrad. We also report strong empirical results on two large scale tasks, namely BOLT Chinese!English and WMT German!English, where our final systems outperform results reported by Setiawan and Zhou (2013) and on matrix.statmt.org. On the WMT task, discriminative training is performed on the full training data of 4M sentence pairs, which is unsurpassed in the literature."

Compounds are a known challenge both in Machine Translation (MT) and Translation in general as well as in other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. In the case of SMT, German compounds are split into their constituents to decrease the number of unknown words and improve the results of evaluation measures like the Bleu score. To assess to which extent it is necessary to deal with German compounds as a part of preprocessing in SMT systems, we have tested different compound splitters and strategies, such as adding lists of compounds and their translations to the training set. This paper summarizes the results of our experiments and attempts to yield better translations of German nominal compounds into Spanish and shows how our approach improves by up to 1.4 Bleu points with respect to the baseline."

However, a punctuation prediction system based on phrase-based translation is not able to capture long-range dependencies between words and punctuation marks. In this paper, we propose to employ hierarchical translation in place of phrase-based translation and show that this approach is more robust for unseen word sequences. Furthermore, we analyze different optimization criteria for tuning the scaling factors of a monolingual statistical machine translation system. In our experiments, we compare the new approach with other punctuation prediction methods and show improvements in terms of F1-Score and BLEU on the IWSLT 2014 GermanâEnglish and EnglishâFrench translation tasks."
