The proposed framework enables us to rigorously compare models of word senses with respect to their fit to the data. We perform extensive experiments and select the empirically most adequate model."

We investigate German closed noun compounds and focus on the interaction of compound-based lexical features (such as frequency and productivity) and terminology-based features (contrasting domain-specific and general language) across word representations and classifiers. Our prediction experiments complement insights from classification using (a) manually designed features to characterise termhood and compound formation and (b) compound and constituent word embeddings. We find that for a broad binary distinction into {`}easy{'} vs. {`}difficult{'} general-language compound frequency is sufficient, but for a more fine-grained four-class distinction it is crucial to include contrastive termhood features and compound and constituent features."

A major challenge for automatic claim classification is the large number and low frequency of such subclasses. We address it by jointly predicting pairs of matching super- and subcategories. We operationalize this idea by (a) encoding soft constraints in the claim classifier and (b) imposing hard constraints via Integer Linear Programming. Our experiments with different claim classifiers on a German immigration newspaper corpus show consistent performance increases for joint prediction, in particular for infrequent categories and discuss the complementarity of the two approaches."

With the aims of disentangling the effects of these choices and identifying a simple yet widely applicable architecture, we introduce STEPS, a new modular graph-based dependency parser. Using STEPS, we perform a series of analyses on the UD corpora of a diverse set of languages. We find that the choice of pre-trained embeddings has by far the greatest impact on parser performance and identify XLM-R as a robust choice across the languages in our study. Adding LSTM layers provides no benefits when using transformer-based embeddings. A multi-task training setup outputting additional UD features may contort results. Taking these insights together, we propose a simple but widely applicable parser architecture and configuration, achieving new state-of-the-art results (in terms of LAS) for 10 out of 12 diverse languages."

Examining the problem both from a linguistic perspective and from a downstream viewpoint, we here argue for a negation-instance based approach to evaluating negation resolution. Our proposed metrics correspond to expectations over per-instance scores and hence are intuitively interpretable. To render research comparable and to foster future work, we provide results for a set of current state-of-the-art systems for negation resolution on three English corpora, and make our implementation of the evaluation scripts publicly available."

Therefore, combining the outputs of parsers from both paradigms used to be the standard approach to improve or analyze their performance. However, with the recent adoption of deep contextualized word representations, the chief weakness of graph-based models, i.e., their limited scope of features, has been mitigated. Through two popular combination techniques {--} blending and stacking {--} we demonstrate that the remaining diversity in the parsing models is reduced below the level of models trained with different random seeds. Thus, an integration no longer leads to increased accuracy. When both parsers depend on BiLSTMs, the graph-based architecture has a consistent advantage. This advantage stems from globally-trained BiLSTM representations, which capture more distant look-ahead syntactic relations. Such representations can be exploited through multi-task learning, which improves the transition-based parser, especially on treebanks with a high ratio of right-headed dependencies."

We show that features drawn from partial subtrees become redundant when the BiLSTMs are used.

I start this talk by sketching some sample scenarios of Digital Humanities projects which involve various Humanities and Social Science disciplines, noting that the potential for a meaningful contribution to higher-level questions is highest when the employed language technological models are carefully tailored both (a) to characteristics of the given target corpus, and (b) to relevant analytical subtasks feeding the discipline-specific research questions. Keeping up a multidisciplinary perspective, I then point out a recurrent dilemma in Digital Humanities projects that follow the conventional set-up of collaboration: to build high-quality computational models for the data, fixed analytical targets should be specified as early as possible {--} but to be able to respond to Humanities questions as they evolve over the course of analysis, the analytical machinery should be kept maximally flexible. To reach both, I argue for a novel collaborative culture that rests on a more interleaved, continuous dialogue. (Re-)Specification of analytical targets should be an ongoing process in which the Humanities Scholars and Social Scientists play a role that is as important as the Computational Scientists{'} role. A promising approach lies in the identification of re-occurring types of analytical subtasks, beyond linguistic standard tasks, which can form building blocks for text analysis across disciplines, and for which corpus-based characterizations (viz. annotations) can be collected, compared and revised. On such grounds, computational modeling is more directly tied to the evolving research questions, and hence the seemingly opposing needs of reliable target specifications vs. {``}malleable{''} frameworks of analysis can be reconciled. Experimental work following this approach is under way in the Center for Reflected Text Analytics (CRETA) in Stuttgart."
Q16-1012,Learning to Make Inferences in a Semantic Parsing Task,2016,38,2,2,1,3542,kyle richardson,Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,0,"We introduce a new approach to training a semantic parser that uses textual entailment judgements as supervision. These judgements are based on high-level inferences about whether the meaning of one sentence follows from another. When applied to an existing semantic parsing task, they prove to be a useful tool for revealing semantic distinctions and background knowledge not captured in the target representations. This information is used to improve the quality of the semantic representations being learned and to acquire generic knowledge for reasoning. Experiments are done on the benchmark Sportscaster corpus (Chen and Mooney, 2008), and a novel RTE-inspired inference dataset is introduced. On this new dataset our method strongly outperforms several strong baselines. Separately, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the original Sportscaster semantic parsing task."
P16-1181,How to Train Dependency Parsers with Inexact Search for Joint Sentence Boundary Detection and Parsing of Entire Documents,2016,34,1,4,0.88559,18856,anders bjorkelund,Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),1,"We cast sentence boundary detection and syntactic parsing as a joint problem, so an entire text document forms a training instance for transition-based dependency parsing. When trained with an early update or max-violation strategy for inexact search, we observe that only a tiny part of these very long training instances is ever exploited. We demonstrate this effect by extending the ArcStandard transition system with swap for the joint prediction task. When we use an alternative update strategy, our models are considerably better on both tasks and train in substantially less time compared to models trained with early update/max-violation. A comparison between a standard pipeline and our joint model furthermore empirically shows the usefulness of syntactic information on the task of sentence boundary detection."

Data deviating from the norm requires tools adjusted to this data. We explore to which extend the availability of such training material and resources related to it influences the accuracy of PoS tagging. We investigate a variety of algorithms including neural nets, conditional random fields and self-learning techniques in order to find the best-fitted approach to tackle data sparsity. Although methods using resources from related languages outperform weakly supervised methods using just a few training examples, we can still reach a promising accuracy with methods abstaining additional resources."

We propose to indirectly take into account the property information for the {``}non-prominent{''} name bearers, such as nationality and profession (e.g., for a Canadian law professor named Michael Jackson, with no Wikipedia article, it is very hard to obtain reliable textual training data). The target property information for the entities is directly available from name authority files, or inferrable, e.g., from listings of sportspeople etc. Our proposed approach employs topic modeling to exploit textual training data based on entities sharing the relevant properties. In experiments with a pilot implementation of the general approach, we show that the approach does indeed work well for name/referent pairs with limited textual coverage in the training data."

However, the actual desire of a user is often one step further: Produce a ranking corresponding to specific needs such that a selection process is supported. In this work, we aim towards closing this gap. We present the task to rank products based on sentiment information and discuss necessary steps towards addressing this task. This includes, on the one hand, the identification of gold rankings as a fundament for an objective function and evaluation and, on the other hand, methods to rank products based on review information. To demonstrate early results on that task, we employ real world examples of rankings as gold standard that are of interest to potential customers as well as product managers, in our case the sales ranking provided by Amazon.com and the quality ranking by Snapsort.com. As baseline methods, we use the average star ratings and review frequencies. Our best textbased approximation of the sales ranking achieves a Spearmanxe2x80x99s correlation coefficient of = 0.23. On the Snapsort data, a ranking based on extracting comparisons leads to = 0.51. In addition, we show that aspect-specific rankings can be used to measure the impact of specific aspects on the ranking."

To the extent that such comparisons can be captured reliably by automatic means, they can provide an extremely helpful input to support a process of choice. As the small amount of available training data limits the development of robust systems to automatically detect comparisons, this paper investigates how to use semi-supervised strategies to expand a small set of labeled sentences. Specifically, we use structural alignment, a method that starts out from a seed set of manually annotated data and finds similar unlabeled sentences to which the labels can be projected. We present several adaptations of the method to our task of comparison detection and show that adding the found expansion sentences slightly improves over a non-expanded baseline in low-resource settings, i.e., when a very small amount of training data is available."

For each sentence we have annotated detailed information about the comparisons it contains: The comparative predicate that expresses the comparison, the type of the comparison, the two entities that are being compared, and the aspect they are compared in. The results of our agreement study show that the decision whether a sentence contains a comparison is difficult to make even for trained human annotators. Once that decision is made, we can achieve consistent results for the very detailed annotations. In total, we have annotated 2108 comparisons in 1707 sentences from camera reviews which makes our corpus the largest resource currently available.

This reduces the amount of human effort required to develop a new language resource. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to convert an HPSG-based treebank into its parallel dependency-based treebank. With this converter, we can automatically create a new language resource from an existing treebank developed based on a grammar formalism.

In this paper, we discuss a dataset and experimental set-up that allows us to systematically explore the effects of different sizes and types of context in this disambiguation task. We create context by first identifying coreferent expressions in the document and then combining sentences these expressions occur in to one informative context. We apply different filters to obtain different levels of coreference-based context. Since hand-labeling a dataset of a decent size is expensive, we investigate the usefulness of an automatically created pseudo-ambiguity dataset. The results on this pseudo-ambiguity dataset show that using coreference-based context performs better than using a fixed window of context around the entity. The insights taken from the pseudo data experiments can be used to predict how the method works with real data. In our experiments on real data we obtain comparable results."

The standard pipeline approach in syntactic dependency parsing assumes a complete disambiguation of morphological case information prior to automatic syntactic analysis. Parsing experiments on Czech, German, and Hungarian show that this approach is susceptible to propagating morphological annotation errors when parsing languages displaying syncretism in their morphological case paradigms. We develop a different architecture where we use case as a possibly underspecified filtering device restricting the options for syntactic analysis. Carefully designed morpho-syntactic constraints can delimit the search space of a statistical dependency parser and exclude solutions that would violate the restrictions overtly marked in the morphology of the words in a given sentence. The constrained system outperforms a state-of-the-art data-driven pipeline architecture, as we show experimentally, and, in addition, the parser output comes with guarantees about local and global morpho-syntactic wellformedness, which can be useful for downstream applications."

We discuss the conversion process and the heuristics, and describe some design decisions and error corrections that we applied to the corpus. Since most of today's data-driven dependency parsers are not able to handle empty nodes directly during parsing, our conversion tool also derives a canonical dependency format without empty nodes. It is shown experimentally to be well suited for training statistical dependency parsers by comparing the performance of two parsers from different parsing paradigms on the data set of the CoNLL 2009 Shared Task data and our corpus."

We compare the end-to-end performance of a parametrized state-of-the-art coreference resolution system on the English data from the CoNLL 2012 shared task. On their own, phrase structures are more useful than dependencies, but the combinations yield highest performance and a significant improvement on the resolution of pronouns. Enriching phrase structure with dependency trees obtained from an independent parser is most helpful, but an extension of the predicted phrase structure using just pattern-based phraseto-dependency conversion seems to provide signals for the machine learning that cannot be distilled from phrase structure alone (despite intense feature selection). This is an interesting result for a highly configurational language: It is easier to learn generalizations over grammatical constraints on coreference when grammatical relations are explicitly provided."

We look at learning light inference patterns for Semantic Parsing within this paradigm, focusing on detecting speaker commitments about events under discussion (Nairn et al., 2006; Karttunen, 2012). We adapt PCFG induction techniques (Borschinger et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2012) for learning inference using event polarity and context as supervision, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a modified portion of the Grounded World corpus (Bordes et al., 2010)."

In this paper, we present an in-depth study into the challenges of introducing empty heads into dependency structures during automatic parsing. Structurally, empty heads provide an attachment site for the dependents of the non-overt material and thus preserve the linguistically plausible structure of the sentence. We compare three different (computational) approaches to the introduction of empty heads and evaluate them against German and Hungarian data. We then conduct a fine-grained error analysis on the output of one of the approaches to highlight some of the difficulties of the task. We find that while a clearly defined part of the phenomena can be learned by the parser, more involved elliptical structures are still mostly out of reach of the automatic tools."

We use two morphosyntactic phenomena of German to show that while lexicalization does indeed suffice to a large extent when recovering the internal structure of noun phrases, an accurate explicit representation can support the correct selection of its grammatical function."

We investigate the relationship between the surface realisation performance and the character of the input to generation, i.e. its degree of underspecification. We extend a syntactic surface realisation system, which can be trained to choose among word order variants, such that the candidate set includes active and passive variants. This allows us to study the interaction of voice and word order alternations in realistic German corpus data. We show that with an appropriately underspecified input, a linguistically informed realisation model trained to regenerate strings from the underlying semantic representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the original voice."

We show that allowing for general adverb conversion of participles in the German LFG grammar seriously affects its overall performance, due to increased spurious ambiguity. As a solution, we present a corpus-based cross-lingual induction technique that detects adverbially used participles in parallel text. In a grammar-based evaluation, we show that the automatically induced resource appropriately restricts the adverb conversion to a limited class of participles, and improves parsing quantitatively as well as qualitatively."
P10-1111,Hard Constraints for Grammatical Function Labelling,2010,33,8,3,1,17921,wolfgang seeker,Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"For languages with (semi-) free word order (such as German), labelling grammatical functions on top of phrase-structural constituent analyses is crucial for making them interpretable. Unfortunately, most statistical classifiers consider only local information for function labelling and fail to capture important restrictions on the distribution of core argument functions such as subject, object etc., namely that there is at most one subject (etc.) per clause. We augment a statistical classifier with an integer linear program imposing hard linguistic constraints on the solution space output by the classifier, capturing global distributional restrictions. We show that this improves labelling quality, in particular for argument grammatical functions, in an intrinsic evaluation, and, importantly, grammar coverage for treebank-based (Lexical-Functional) grammar acquisition and parsing, in an extrinsic evaluation."

The corpus is intended to reduce or make more effective the manual task of finding examples of clefts in a corpus. The corpus is being developed in the context of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 632, which is a large, interdisciplinary research initiative to study information structure, at the University of Potsdam and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The corpus is based on the Europarl corpus (version 3). We show how state-of-the-art NLP tools, like POS taggers and statistical dependency parsers, may facilitate powerful and precise searches. We argue that identifying clefts using automatically added syntactic structure annotation is ultimately to be preferred over using lower level, though more robust, extraction methods like regular expression matching. An evaluation of the extraction method for one of the languages also offers some support for this method. We end the paper by discussing the resulting corpus itself. We present some examples of interesting clefts and translational counterparts from the corpus and suggest ways of exploiting our newly created resource in the cross-linguistic study of clefts."

In order to achieve high-quality annotation relatively fast, we first generated an accurate lexicon that draws on existing word and name lists and takes into account inflectional and derivational morphology. The main motivation for the tagged corpus is to obtain data for training automatic taggers with machine learning approaches. Hence, we took machine learning considerations into account during tagset design and we present training experiments as part of this paper. The best automatic tagger achieves an accuracy of 95.2{\%} in cross-validation experiments. We also wanted to create a basis for experimenting with annotation projection techniques, which exploit parallel corpora. For this reason, it was useful to use a part of the Bible as the gold standard corpus, for which sentence-aligned parallel versions in many languages are easy to obtain. We also report on preliminary experiments exploiting a statistical word alignment of the parallel text."

We show how the partial dependency trees projected from English to Dutch, Italian and German can be exploited to train parsers for the target languages. We evaluate the parsers against manual gold standard annotations and find that the projected parsers substantially outperform our heuristic baselines by 9â25{\%} UAS, which corresponds to a 21â43{\%} reduction in error rate. A comparative error analysis focuses on how the projected target language parsers handle subjects, which is especially interesting for Italian as an instance of a pro-drop language. For Dutch, we further present experiments with German as an alternative source language. In both source languages, we contrast standard baseline parsers with parsers that are enhanced with the predictions from large-scale LFG grammars through a technique of parser stacking, and show that improvements of the source language parser can directly lead to similar improvements of the projected target language parser."

Making relatively small changes to a range of very different system components, we were able to increase labeled accuracy on a standard test set (from the CoNLL 2009 shared task), ignoring gold standard part-of-speech tags, from 87.64% to 89.40%. The study was conducted in less than five weeks and as a secondary project of all four authors. Effective modifications include the quality and combination of auto-assigned morphosyntactic features entering machine learning, the internal feature handling as well as the inclusion of global constraints and a combination of different parsing strategies."

We analyze our approach in an annotation projection framework for dependency trees, and show how dependency parsers from two different paradigms (graph-based and transition-based) can be trained on the resulting tree fragments. We train parsers for Dutch to evaluate our method and to investigate to which degree graph-based and transition-based parsers can benefit from incomplete training data. We find that partial correspondence projection gives rise to parsers that out-perform parsers trained on aggressively filtered data sets, and achieve unlabeled attachment scores that are only 5% behind the average UAS for Dutch in the CoNLL-X Shared Task on supervised parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006)."

The approach exploits advanced existing analysis tools for high-density languages and word-aligned multi-parallel corpora to bridge across languages. The goal is to find a methodology that minimizes the amount of human expert intervention needed, while producing high-quality search and annotation tools. One of the main challenges is the susceptibility of a complex system combining various automatic analysis components to hard-to-control noise from a number of sources. We present systematic experiments investigating to what degree the noise issue can be overcome by (i) exploiting more than one perspective on the target language data by considering multiple translations in the parallel corpus, and (ii) using minimally supervised learning techniques such as co-training and self-training to take advantage of a larger pool of data for generalization. We observe that while (i) does help in the training individual machine learning models, a cyclic bootstrapping process seems to suffer too much from noise. A preliminary conclusion is that in a practical approach, one has to rely on a higher degree of supervision or on noise detection heuristics."

Some preliminary experiments addressing the bootstrapping aspects are presented.The representation format for syntactic correspondence across parallel text that we propose as the starting point for a process of successive refinement emphasizes correspondences of major constituents that realize semantic arguments or modifiers; language-particular details of morphosyntactic realization are intentionally left largely unlabelled.

In this paper we focus on the combination of multiple information sources, which we see as being vital for a robust classification system. We use a deep syntactic grammar of English to identify morphological, syntactic, and discourse clues, and we use various lexical databases for fine-grained semantic properties of the predicators. Experiments performed to date show that enhancing the output of the grammar with information from lexical resources improves recall but lowers precision in the situation entity classification task."
