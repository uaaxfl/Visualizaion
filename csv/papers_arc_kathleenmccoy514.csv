But we had to be sure that topic models were stable for the sampled corpora. To that end we developed a methodology for aligning multiple hierarchical structure topic models run over the same corpus under similar conditions, calculating a representative centroid model, and reporting stability of the centroid model. We ran stability experiments for standard corpora and a development corpus of Global Warming articles. We found flat and hierarchical structures of two levels plus the root offer stable centroid models, but hierarchical structures of three levels plus the root didn{'}t seem stable enough for use in hierarchical summarization."

Unfortunately, information retrieval research has focused on the retrieval of text documents and images, with almost no attention specifically directed toward the retrieval of information graphics. Our work is the first to directly tackle the retrieval of infographics and to design a system that takes into account their unique characteristics. Learning-to-rank algorithms are applied on a large set of features to develop several models for infographics retrieval. Evaluation of the models shows that features pertaining to the structure and the content of graphics should be taken into account when retrieving graphics and that doing so results in a model with better performance than a baseline model that relies on matching query words with words in the graphic."

The graphic, whose communicative goal (intended message) is often not captured by the documentxe2x80x99s accompanying text, contributes to the overall purpose of the document and cannot be ignored. This article presents our approach to providing the high-level content of a non-scientific information graphic via a brief textual summary which includes the intended message and the salient features of the graphic. This work brings together insights obtained from empirical studies in order to determine what should be contained in the summaries of this form of non-linguistic input data, and how the information required for realizing the selected content can be extracted from the visual image and the textual components of the graphic. This work also presents a novel bottomxe2x80x93up generation approach to simultaneously construct the discourse and sentence structures of textual summaries by leveraging different discourse related considerations such as the syntactic complexity of realized sentences and clause embeddings.

To identify these areas, we had visual readers skim for an answer to a complex question while being tracked by an eye-tracking system. Analysis of these results indicates that text with semantic connections to the question are of interest, but these connections are much looser than can be identified with traditional Question-Answering or Information Retrieval techniques.

In the first step, a set of systematically constructed texts are used to identify an extension of the focusing framework to handle a particular kind of complex sentence. In the second step, a corpus analysis is used to confirm the extension. We explain how our methodology overcomes the difficulties faced by other approaches."

The linguistic model helps the system identify errors along with their probable source(s). This information is crucial for effective correction. It is also useful in the response phase of the system to focus tutoring on the errors that are most beneficial to correct. In addition, the linguistic model can be used to tailor the system's realization of its response. In this way, the syntactic constructions generated by the system will provide understandable and positive exemplars of the language features currently being acquired by the leamer."
J94-2006,{RAFT}/{RAPR} and Centering: a comparison and discussion of problems related to processing complex sentences,1994,15,44,2,1,54956,linda suri,Computational Linguistics,0,"abstract preferences underlying the frameworks share much in common, the approaches very often make the same predictions. RAFT/RAPR's focusing and pronoun resolution algorithms reflect the following underlying abstract preferences: We prefer for the CF to be something that is co-referential with an element mentioned earlier in the discourse. We prefer for the CF to be a pronoun rather than a full definite description. We use preferences for resolving pronouns and computing the CF that involve the grammatical role of the pronoun. We prefer for the CF to be the same as the last CF and the SF to be the same as the last SF. Centering shares the first two of these in common with us. But, centering prefers the local focus to stay the same and for the subject to be the local focus (which is stronger than preference 4). As noted earlier, we do not apply preference 2 without regard for the grammatical roles of the NPs and which focusing data structures they co-specify. Furthermore, centering invokes the second preference during pronoun resolution, while we invoke it only after resolving the pronouns. In addition, centering requires that the focus (Cb) realizes an element in the immediately preceding sentence, as opposed to merely preferring for the focus to be something in the immediately preceding sentence but allowing it instead to be co-referential with an element further back in the preceding text (as RAFT/RAPR does). In sum, the order in which these abstract preferences are applied differs between the two frameworks. Furthermore, as a result of (some) differences between the frameworks with respect to these preferences, resolvhlg a pronoun to have the same grammatical role as its antecedent is less important in centering than it is in RAFT/RAPR (Section 4.3). RAFT/RAPR presents possible referents for pronouns one possibility at a time, and if pragmatic, semantic, and general knowledge inferencing rejects a referent, RAFT/RAPR proposes an alternative. Centering, on the other hand, (in addition to requiring this same kind of inferencing) sometimes suggests multiple possibilities for the co-specifications of pronouns in a sentence (Walker 1989). Is pragmatic inferencing applied at this point to pick among the possible antecedents? We assume this to be the case, otherwise it is not clear how centering will choose among the multiple potential referents. Yet, assuming this is the case, centering seems to involve more complex inferencing than our approach involves; inferencing for centering must pick which antecedent is better. RAFT/RAPR only asks inferencing to confirm a co-specification. 19 19 We do not check for ambiguity of pronouns in the same way that Sidner did. However, even if we were to incorporate similar checks for ambiguity, such checks would involve using inferencing to confirm two possible co-specifications for a pronoun, while centering might require the use of inferencing to confirm more than two. Thus, the inferencing required by RAFT/RAPR would still be more limited than that required by centering. 315"

J88-3005,Reasoning on a Highlighted User Model to Respond to Misconceptions,1988,20,53,1,1,31670,kathleen mccoy,Computational Linguistics,0,"Responses to misconceptions given by human conversational partners very often contain information refuting possible reasoning which may have led to the misconceptions. Surprisingly there is a great deal of regularity in these responses across different domains of discourse. For instance, one reason a user might have given an object a property it does not have is that the user confused the object with another similar object. In correcting such a misconception, a human conversational partner is likely to point out this possible confusion.This work describes a method for generating responses like the one just described by reasoning on a highlighted model of the user to identify possible sources of the error. Through a transcript study a number of response strategies were abstracted. Each strategy was associated with a structural configuration of the user model. For example, the above mentioned strategy of pointing out a similar confused object is associated with a configuration of the user model that indicates the user believes there is an important similar object that has the property involved in the misconception. Upon finding that configuration in the highlighted user model, the system can respond with the associated strategy.Notice that the reasoning must be done on a highlighted user model since the perception of both an object's importance and its similarity with another object change with the perspective being taken on the domain. This paper investigates how domain perspective can be modeled to provide the needed highlighting and introduces a similarity metric that is sensitive to the highlighting provided by the domain perspective. Finally, the paper shows how the highlighting affects misconception responses."

P86-1016,The {ROMPER} System: Responding to Object-Related Misconceptions using Perspective,1986,17,31,1,1,31670,kathleen mccoy,24th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"As a user interacts with a database or expert system, s/he may reveal a misconception about the objects modeled by the system. This paper discusses the ROMPER system for responding to such misconceptions in a domain independent and context sensitive fashion. ROMPER reasons about possible sources of the misconception. It operates on a model of the user and generates a cooperative response based on this reasoning. The process is made context sensitive by augmenting the user model with a new notion of object perspective which highlights certain aspects of the user model due to previous discourse."

P84-1090,Correcting Object-Related Misconceptions: How Should The System Respond?,1984,9,6,1,1,31670,kathleen mccoy,10th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 22nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"This paper describes a computational method for correcting users' misconceptions concerning the objects modelled by a computer system. The method involves classifying object-related misconceptions according to the knowledge-base feature involved in the incorrect information. For each resulting class sub-types are identified, according to the structure of the knowledge base, which indicate what information may be supporting the misconception and therefore what information to include in the response. Such a characterization, along with a model of what the user knows, enables the system to reason in a domain-independent way about how best to correct the user."
P82-1029,Augmenting a Database Knowledge Representation for Natural Language Generation,1982,5,15,1,1,31670,kathleen mccoy,20th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"The knowledge representation is an important factor in natural language generation since it limits the semantic capabilities of the generation system. This paper identifies several information types in a knowledge representation that can be used to generate meaningful responses to questions about database structure. Creating such a knowledge representation, however, is a long and tedious process. A system is presented which uses the contents of the database to form part of this knowledge representation automatically. It employs three types of world knowledge axioms to ensure that the representation formed is meaningful and contains salient information."
