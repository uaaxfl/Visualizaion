In the textual analysis, joint extracting both aspect terms and sentiment polarities has been drawn much attention due to the better applications than individual sub-task. However, in the multi-modal scenario, the existing studies are limited to handle each sub-task independently, which fails to model the innate connection between the above two objectives and ignores the better applications. Therefore, in this paper, we are the first to jointly perform multi-modal ATE (MATE) and multi-modal ASC (MASC), and we propose a multi-modal joint learning approach with auxiliary cross-modal relation detection for multi-modal aspect-level sentiment analysis (MALSA). Specifically, we first build an auxiliary text-image relation detection module to control the proper exploitation of visual information. Second, we adopt the hierarchical framework to bridge the multi-modal connection between MATE and MASC, as well as separately visual guiding for each sub module. Finally, we can obtain all aspect-level sentiment polarities dependent on the jointly extracted specific aspects. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach against the joint textual approaches, pipeline and collapsed multi-modal approaches."

Previous works only focus on the textual modality, but there are often audio and video utterances (such as news broadcast and face-to-face dialogues), where textual, acoustic and visual modalities normally exist. To this end, we attempt to combine the multi-modality (mainly the converted text and actual voice information) to perform CWS. In this paper, we annotate a new dataset for CWS containing text and audio. Moreover, we propose a time-dependent multi-modal interactive model based on Transformer framework to integrate multi-modal information for word sequence labeling. The experimental results on three different training sets show the effectiveness of our approach with fusing text and audio."

In this study, we propose a novel and extensible dialogue generation method by leveraging sellers{'} historical dialogue information, which can be both accessible and informative. By utilizing innovative historical dialogue representation learning and historical dialogue selection mechanism, the proposed model is capable of detecting most related responses from sellers{'} historical dialogues, which can further enhance the current dialogue generation quality. Unlike prior dialogue generation efforts, we treat each seller{'}s historical dialogues as a list of Customer-Seller utterance pairs and allow the model to measure their different importance, and copy words directly from most relevant pairs. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach can generate high-quality responses that cater to specific sellers{'} characteristics and exhibit consistent superiority over baselines on a real-world multi-turn customer service dialogue dataset."

However, almost all existing studies focus on one modality (e.g., textual modality). In this paper, we focus on multi-label emotion detection in a multi-modal scenario. In this scenario, we need to consider both the dependence among different labels (label dependence) and the dependence between each predicting label and different modalities (modality dependence). Particularly, we propose a multi-modal sequence-to-set approach to effectively model both kinds of dependence in multi-modal multi-label emotion detection. The detailed evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

Inspired by this, we argue that the global topic information derived from user-generated contents (e.g., texts and images) is crucial to boost the performance of the depression detection task, though this information has been neglected by almost all previous studies on depression detection. To this end, we propose a new Multimodal Topic-enriched Auxiliary Learning (MTAL) approach, aiming at capturing the topic information inside different modalities (i.e., texts and images) for depression detection. Especially, in our approach, a modality-agnostic topic model is proposed to be capable of mining the topical clues from either the discrete textual signals or the continuous visual signals. On this basis, the topic modeling w.r.t. the two modalities are cast as two auxiliary tasks for improving the performance of the primary task (i.e., depression detection). Finally, the detailed evaluation demonstrates the great advantage of our MTAL approach to depression detection over the state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of the multimodal topic information to depression detection and the effectiveness of our approach in capturing such information."

In this study, we propose a Neural Sentiment Forecasting (NSF) model to address inherent challenges. In particular, we employ a neural simulation model to simulate the next utterance based on the context (previous utterances encountered). Moreover, we employ a sequence influence model to learn both pair-wise and seq-wise influence. Empirical studies illustrate the importance of proposed sentiment forecasting task, and justify the effectiveness of our NSF model over several strong baselines."

In this paper, we explore two kinds of sentiment preference information inside a document, i.e., contextual sentiment consistency w.r.t. the same aspect (namely intra-aspect sentiment consistency) and contextual sentiment tendency w.r.t. all the related aspects (namely inter-aspect sentiment tendency). On the basis, we propose a Cooperative Graph Attention Networks (CoGAN) approach for cooperatively learning the aspect-related sentence representation. Specifically, two graph attention networks are leveraged to model above two kinds of document-level sentiment preference information respectively, followed by an interactive mechanism to integrate the two-fold preference. Detailed evaluation demonstrates the great advantage of the proposed approach to ASC over the state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of the document-level sentiment preference information to ASC and the effectiveness of our approach capturing such information."

Especially, to determine which words are valuable for a particular emotion dimension, an attention layer is trained to weight the words in an input sequence. Furthermore, adversarial training is employed between two attention layers to learn better word weights via a discriminator. In particular, a shared attention layer is incorporated to learn public word weights between two emotion dimensions.

Existing approaches consider the posts individually and predict their emotions independently. Different from previous researches, we explore the dependence among relevant posts via the authors{'} backgrounds, since the authors with similar backgrounds, e.g., gender, location, tend to express similar emotions. However, such personal attributes are not easy to obtain in most social media websites, and it is hard to capture attributes-aware words to connect similar people. Accordingly, we propose a Neural Personal Discrimination (NPD) approach to address above challenges by determining personal attributes from posts, and connecting relevant posts with similar attributes to jointly learn their emotions. In particular, we employ adversarial discriminators to determine the personal attributes, with attention mechanisms to aggregate attributes-aware words. In this way, social correlationship among different posts can be better addressed. Experimental results show the usefulness of personal attributes, and the effectiveness of our proposed NPD approach in capturing such personal attributes with significant gains over the state-of-the-art models."

This approach incorporates clause selection and word selection strategies to tackle the data noise problem in the task of DASC. First, a high-level policy is proposed to select aspect-relevant clauses and discard noisy clauses. Then, a low-level policy is proposed to select sentiment-relevant words and discard noisy words inside the selected clauses. Finally, a sentiment rating predictor is designed to provide reward signals to guide both clause and word selection. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive effectiveness of the proposed approach to DASC over the state-of-the-art baselines."

To address these challenges, we propose a novel active learning approach, named co-selecting, by taking both the imbalanced class distribution issue and uncertainty into account. Specifically, our co-selecting approach employs two feature subspace classifiers to collectively select most informative minority-class samples for manual annotation by leveraging a certainty measurement and an uncertainty measurement, and in the meanwhile, automatically label most informative majority-class samples, to reduce human-annotation efforts. Extensive experiments across four domains demonstrate great potential and effectiveness of our proposed co-selecting approach to active learning for imbalanced sentiment classification."
C12-2067,Active Learning for {C}hinese Word Segmentation,2012,33,8,1,1,9448,shoushan li,Proceedings of {COLING} 2012: Posters,0,"Currently, the best performing models for Chinese word segmentation (CWS) are extremely resource intensive in terms of annotation data quanti ty. One promising solution to minimize the cost of data acquisition is active learning, which aims to actively select the most useful instances to annotate for learning. Active learning on CWS, h owever, remains challenging due to its inherent nature. In this paper, we propose a Word Bounda ry Annotation (WBA) model to make effective active learning on CWS possible. This is achie ved by annotating only those uncertain boundaries. In this way, the manual annotation cost is l argely reduced, compared to annotating the whole character sequence. To further minimize the a nnotation effort, a diversity measurement among the instances is considered to avoid duplicat e annotation. Experimental results show that employing the WBA model and the diversity measurement into active learning on CWS can save much annotation cost with little loss in the perfor mance."
P10-1043,Employing Personal/Impersonal Views in Supervised and Semi-Supervised Sentiment Classification,2010,26,71,1,1,9448,shoushan li,Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,"In this paper, we adopt two views, personal and impersonal views, and systematically employ them in both supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification. Here, personal views consist of those sentences which directly express speaker's feeling and preference towards a target object while impersonal views focus on statements towards a target object for evaluation. To obtain them, an unsupervised mining approach is proposed. On this basis, an ensemble method and a co-training algorithm are explored to employ the two views in supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification respectively. Experimental results across eight domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

Given the fact that an emotion is triggered by cause events and that cause events are an integral part of emotion, this paper constructs a Chinese emotion cause corpus as a first step towards automatic inference of cause-emotion correlation. The corpus focuses on five primary emotions, namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise. It is annotated with emotion cause events based on our proposed annotation scheme. Corpus data shows that most emotions are expressed with causes, and that causes mostly occur before the corresponding emotion verbs. We also examine the correlations between emotions and cause events in terms of linguistic cues: causative verbs, perception verbs, epistemic markers, conjunctions, prepositions, and others. Results show that each group of linguistic cues serves as an indicator marking the cause events in different structures of emotional constructions. We believe that the emotion cause corpus will be the useful resource for automatic emotion cause detection as well as emotion detection and classification."

The multi-label model not only detects multi-clause causes, but also captures the long-distance information to facilitate emotion cause detection. In addition, based on the linguistic analysis, we create two sets of linguistic patterns during feature extraction. Both manually generalized patterns and automatically generalized patterns are designed to extract general cause expressions or specific constructions for emotion causes. Experiments show that our system achieves a performance much higher than a baseline model."

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to incorporate polarity shifting information into a document-level sentiment classification system. First, a feature selection method is adopted to automatically generate the training data for a binary classifier on polarity shifting detection of sentences. Then, by using the obtained binary classifier, each document in the original polarity classification training data is split into two partitions, polarity-shifted and polarity-unshifted, which are used to train two base classifiers respectively for further classifier combination. The experimental results across four different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

In this paper, we study on word boundary decision (WBD) approach for Chinese word segmentation and implement it as a 2-tag character tagging with conditional random filed (CRF). With a help of tag transition features, WBD with CRF segmentation approach can achieve comparative performances compared to 4-tag character tagging approach (represents the state-of-the-art segmentation approach). But it requires only about half training time and memory space as much as 4-tag character tagging approach. These results encourage that WBD segmentation approach is a good choice for real Chinese word segmentation systems."

In this paper, we propose an approach to incorporate their classification information into our sentiment classification system: First, we classify sentences into sentiment reversed and non-reversed parts. Then, represent them as two different bags-of-words. Third, present three general strategies to do classification with two-bag-of-words modeling. We collect a large-scale product reviews involving five domains and conduct our experiments on them. The experimental results show that incorporating both negation and contrast transition information is effective and performs robustly better than traditional machine learning approach (based on one-bag-of-words modeling) across five different domains."

However, when dealing with a new task, it is still difficult to quickly select a suitable one from various FS methods provided by many previous studies. In this paper, we propose a theoretic framework of FS methods based on two basic measurements: frequency measurement and ratio measurement. Then six popular FS methods are in detail discussed under this framework. Moreover, with the guidance of our theoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called weighed frequency and odds (WFO) that combines the two measurements with trained weights. The experimental results on data sets from both topic-based and sentiment classification tasks show that this new method is robust across different tasks and numbers of selected features."

Experimental studies show that multi-domain sentiment classification using the classifier-level approach performs much better than single domain classification (using the training data individually)."
C08-1137,Sentence Type Based Reordering Model for Statistical Machine Translation,2008,13,11,3,0,6594,jiajun zhang,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008),0,"Many reordering approaches have been proposed for the statistical machine translation (SMT) system. However, the information about the type of source sentence is ignored in the previous works. In this paper, we propose a group of novel reordering models based on the source sentence type for Chinese-to-English translation. In our approach, an SVM-based classifier is employed to classify the given Chinese sentences into three types: special interrogative sentences, other interrogative sentences, and non-question sentences. The different reordering models are developed oriented to the different sentence types. Our experiments show that the novel reordering models have obtained an improvement of more than 2.65% in BLEU for a phrase-based spoken language translation system."
