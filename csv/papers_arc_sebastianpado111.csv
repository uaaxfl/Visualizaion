We hypothesize that people{'}s (in)confidence that they performed well in an annotation task leads to (dis)agreements among each other. If this is true, confidence may serve as a diagnostic tool for systematic differences in annotations. To probe our assumption, we conduct a study on a subset of the Corpus of Contemporary American English, in which we ask raters to distinguish neutral sentences from emotion-bearing ones, while scoring the confidence of their answers. Confidence turns out to approximate inter-annotator disagreements. Further, we find that confidence is correlated to emotion intensity: perceiving stronger affect in text prompts annotators to more certain classification performances. This insight is relevant for modelling studies of intensity, as it opens the question wether automatic regressors or classifiers actually predict intensity, or rather human{'}s self-perceived confidence."

However, when the target classes are strongly correlated with other textual attributes, text classification models can pick up {``}wrong{''} features, leading to bad generalization and biases. In social media analysis, this problem surfaces for demographic user classes such as language, topic, or gender, which influence the generate text to a substantial extent. Adversarial training has been claimed to mitigate this problem, but thorough evaluation is missing. In this paper, we experiment with text classification of the correlated attributes of document topic and author gender, using a novel multilingual parallel corpus of TED talk transcripts. Our findings are: (a) individual classifiers for topic and author gender are indeed biased; (b) debiasing with adversarial training works for topic, but breaks down for author gender; (c) gender debiasing results differ across languages. We interpret the result in terms of feature space overlap, highlighting the role of linguistic surface realization of the target classes."

A major challenge for automatic claim classification is the large number and low frequency of such subclasses. We address it by jointly predicting pairs of matching super- and subcategories. We operationalize this idea by (a) encoding soft constraints in the claim classifier and (b) imposing hard constraints via Integer Linear Programming. Our experiments with different claim classifiers on a German immigration newspaper corpus show consistent performance increases for joint prediction, in particular for infrequent categories and discuss the complementarity of the two approaches."

The natural question to ask is how compatible these two formats (manifesto and newspaper reports) are in their representation of party positioning. We address this question with an approach that combines political science (manual annotation and analysis) and natural language processing (supervised claim identification) in a cross-text type setting: we train a classifier on annotated newspaper data and test its performance on manifestos. Our findings show a) strong performance for supervised classification even across text types and b) a substantive overlap between the two formats in terms of party positioning, with differences regarding the salience of specific issues."

This paper investigates the specific hypothesis that the non-propositional level of emotions is at least partially lost in MT. We carry out a number of experiments in a back-translation setup and establish that (1) emotions are indeed partially lost during translation; (2) this tendency can be reversed almost completely with a simple re-ranking approach informed by an emotion classifier, taking advantage of diversity in the n-best list; (3) the re-ranking approach can also be applied to change emotions, obtaining a model for emotion style transfer. An in-depth qualitative analysis reveals that there are recurring linguistic changes through which emotions are toned down or amplified, such as change of modality."

We propose two simple debiasing methods which mask proper names and pronouns during training of the model, thus removing personal information bias. We find that (a) these methods significantly decrease frequency bias while keeping the overall performance stable; and (b) the resulting models improve when evaluated in an out-of-domain setting."

In this paper, we propose the Context Path Model (CPM) which generates explanations for new facts in KBC by providing sets of \textit{context paths} as supporting evidence for these triples. For example, a new triple (Theresa May, nationality, Britain) may be explained by the path (Theresa May, born in, Eastbourne, contained in, Britain). The CPM is formulated as a wrapper that can be applied on top of various existing KBC models. We evaluate it for the well-established TransE model. We observe that its performance remains very close despite the added complexity, and that most of the paths proposed as explanations provide meaningful evidence to assess the correctness."

Even though many tasks in semantics also involve categorization of some kind, theories of categorization do not play a major role in contemporary research in computational linguistics. This paper follows the idea that embedding-based models of semantics lend themselves well to being formulated in terms of classical categorization theories. The benefit is a space of model families that enables (a) the formulation of hypotheses about the impact of major design decisions, and (b) a transparent assessment of these decisions. We instantiate this idea on the task of frame-semantic frame identification. We define four models that cross two design variables: (a) the choice of prototype vs. exemplar categorization, corresponding to different degrees of generalization applied to the input; and (b) the presence vs. absence of a fine-tuning step, corresponding to generic vs. task-adaptive categorization. We find that for frame identification, generalization and task-adaptive categorization both yield substantial benefits. Our prototype-based, fine-tuned model, which combines the best choices for these variables, establishes a new state of the art in frame identification."

In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward neural architecture to jointly predict numeric and categorical attributes based on embeddings learned from textual occurrences of the entities in question. Following insights from multi-task learning, our hypothesis is that due to the correlations among attributes of different kinds, joint prediction improves over separate prediction. Our experiments on seven FreeBase domains show that this hypothesis is true of the two attribute types: we find substantial improvements for numeric attributes in the joint model, while performance remains largely unchanged for categorical attributes. Our analysis indicates that this is the case because categorical attributes, many of which describe membership in various classes, provide useful {`}background knowledge{'} for numeric prediction, while this is true to a lesser degree in the inverse direction."

Motivated by Scherer{'}s appraisal theory, we implement a crowdsourcing experiment which consists of two steps. In step 1, participants create descriptions of emotional events for a given emotion. In step 2, five annotators assess the emotion expressed by the texts. We show that transferring an emotion classification model from the original English ISEAR to the German crowdsourced deISEAR via machine translation does not, on average, cause a performance drop."

In this paper, we show that corpus combination is effective after all when the differences between corpora are bridged with domain adaptation methods. When we combine the SemEval-2010 Task 10 and Gerber and Chai noun corpora, we obtain substantially improved performance on both corpora, for all roles and parts of speech. We also present new insights into the properties of the implicit semantic role labeling task."

In this paper, we identify an inconsistency in PLF between the objective function at training and the prediction at testing which leads to an overcounting of the predicatexe2x80x99s contribution to the meaning of the phrase. We investigate two possible solutions of which one (the exclusion of simple lexical vector at test time) improves performance significantly on two out of the three composition datasets."

Recently, interoperable standards for annotation and preprocessing have been proposed. In contrast, the algorithmic level remains unstandardized, which makes component re-use in this area very difficult in practice. In this paper, we introduce multi-level alignments as a central, powerful representation for TE algorithms that encourages modular, reusable, multilingual algorithm development. We demonstrate that a pilot open-source implementation of multi-level alignment with minimal features competes with state-of-theart open-source TE engines in three languages."

In contrast, it is difficult to extract the values of more specific attributes of word referents from distributional representations, attributes of the kind typically found in structured knowledge bases (Italy has 60 million inhabitants). In this paper, we pursue the hypothesis that distributional vectors also implicitly encode referential attributes. We show that a standard supervised regression model is in fact sufficient to retrieve such attributes to a reasonable degree of accuracy: When evaluated on the prediction of both categorical and numeric attributes of countries and cities, the model consistently reduces baseline error by 30%, and is not far from the upper bound. Further analysis suggests that our model is able to xe2x80x9cobjectifyxe2x80x9d distributional representations for entities, anchoring them more firmly in the external world in measurable ways."

However, their construction requires large, accurately parsed corpora, which are unavailable for most languages. In this paper, we develop a number of methods to overcome this obstacle. We describe (a) a crosslingual approach that constructs a syntax-based model for a new language requiring only an English resource and a translation lexicon; and (b) multilingual approaches that combine crosslingual with monolingual information, subject to availability. We evaluate on two lexical semantic benchmarks in German and Croatian. We find that the models exhibit complementary profiles: crosslingual models yield higher accuracies while monolingual models provide better coverage. In addition, we show that simple multilingual models can successfully combine their strengths."

The new results show how the set of frequent type alternations that can be induced from the lexicon is partly different from the set of polysemy relations selected and explicitely applied by lexicographers when building it. The analysis of mismatches shows that frequent type alternations do not always correpond to prototypical polysemy relations, nevertheless the proposed methodology represents a useful tool offered to lexicographers to systematically check for possible gaps in their resource."

However, there are also many examples of derivationally related lemma pairs whose meanings differ substantially, e.g., objectN xe2x80x90 objective N . Most broad-coverage derivational lexicons do not reflect this distinction, mixing up semantically related and unrelated word pairs. In this paper, we investigate strategies to recover the above distinction by recognizing semantically related lemma pairs, a process we call semantic validation. We make two main contributions: First, we perform a detailed data analysis on the basis of a large German derivational lexicon. It reveals two promising sources of information (distributional semantics and structural information about derivational rules), but also systematic problems with these sources. Second, we develop a classification model for the task that reflects the noisy nature of the data. It achieves an improvement of 13.6% in precision and 5.8% in F1-score over a strong majority class baseline. Our experiments confirm that both information sources contribute to semantic validation, and that they are complementary enough that the best results are obtained from a combined model."

Experimental investigations of logical metonymy must assume a binary distinction between metonymic (i.e. eventselecting) verbs and non-metonymic verbs to establish a control condition. However, this binary distinction (whether a verb is metonymic or not) is mostly made on intuitive grounds, which introduces a potential confounding factor. We describe a corpus-based approach which characterizes verbs in terms of their behavior at the syntax-semantics interface. The model assesses the extent to which transitive verbs prefer event-denoting objects over entity-denoting objects. We then test this xe2x80x9ceventhoodxe2x80x9d measure on psycholinguistic datasets, showing that it can distinguish not only metonymic from non-metonymic verbs, but that it can also capture more fine-grained distinctions among different classes of metonymic verbs, putting such distinctions into a new graded perspective."

Experimental results have shown higher processing costs for metonymic conditions compared with non-metonymic ones (read the book). According to a widely held interpretation, it is the type clash between the event-selecting verb and the entity-denoting object (begin the book) that triggers coercion mechanisms and leads to additional processing effort. We propose an alternative explanation and argue that the extra processing effort is an effect of thematic fit. This is a more economical hypothesis that does not need to postulate a separate type clash mechanism: entitydenoting objects simply have a low fit as objects of event-selecting verbs. We test linguistic datasets from psycholinguistic experiments and find that a structured distributional model of thematic fit, which does not encode any explicit argument type information, is able to replicate all significant experimental findings. This result provides evidence for a graded account of coercion phenomena in which thematic fit accounts for both the trigger of the coercion and the retrieval of the covert event."

We argue that existing models for this task do not take syntactic structure sufficiently into account.n n We present a novel structured vector space model that addresses these issues by incorporating the selectional preferences for words' argument positions. This makes it possible to integrate syntax into the computation of word meaning in context. In addition, the model performs at and above the state of the art for modeling the contextual adequacy of paraphrases."
C08-1084,Semantic Role Assignment for Event Nominalisations by Leveraging Verbal Data,2008,25,20,1,1,411,sebastian pado,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008),0,"This paper presents a novel approach to the task of semantic role labelling for event nominalisations, which make up a considerable fraction of predicates in running text, but are underrepresented in terms of training data and difficult to model. We propose to address this situation by data expansion. We construct a model for nominal role labelling solely from verbal training data. The best quality results from salvaging grammatical features where applicable, and generalising over lexical heads otherwise."
J07-2002,Dependency-Based Construction of Semantic Space Models,2007,78,484,1,1,411,sebastian pado,Computational Linguistics,0,"Traditionally, vector-based semantic space models use word co-occurrence counts from large corpora to represent lexical meaning. In this article we present a novel framework for constructing semantic spaces that takes syntactic relations into account. We introduce a formalization for this class of models, which allows linguistic knowledge to guide the construction process. We evaluate our framework on a range of tasks relevant for cognitive science and natural language processing: semantic priming, synonymy detection, and word sense disambiguation. In all cases, our framework obtains results that are comparable or superior to the state of the art."

Such models have applications both in psycholinguistics and in computational linguistics. By extending a recent model, we obtain a completely corpus-driven model for this task which achieves significant correlations with human judgements. It rivals or exceeds deeper, resource-driven models while exhibiting higher coverage. Moreover, we show that our model can be combined with deeper models to obtain better predictions than from either model alone."

In this paper, we present an improved method for obtaining constituent alignments between parallel sentences to guide the role projection task. Our extensions are twofold: (a) we model constituent alignment as minimum weight edge covers in a bipartite graph, which allows us to find a globally optimal solution efficiently; (b) we propose tree pruning as a promising strategy for reducing alignment noise. Experimental results on an English-German parallel corpus demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models."

H05-1084,Analyzing Models for Semantic Role Assignment using Confusability,2005,19,5,2,0.75,2274,katrin erk,Proceedings of Human Language Technology Conference and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,0,"We analyze models for semantic role assignment by defining a meta-model that abstracts over features and learning paradigms. This meta-model is based on the concept of role confusability, is defined in information-theoretic terms, and predicts that roles realized by less specific grammatical functions are more difficult to assign. We find that confusability is strongly correlated with the performance of classifiers based on syntactic features, but not for classifiers including semantic features. This indicates that syntactic features approximate a description of grammatical functions, and that semantic features provide an independent second view on the data."

We introduce a general framework for semantic projection which exploits parallel texts, is relatively inexpensive and can potentially reduce the amount of effort involved in creating semantic resources. We propose projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information. Experimental results on an English-German parallel corpus demonstrate the advantages of this approach."

The TIGER/SALSA XML format provides a modular representation for semantic roles and syntactic structure. The Text-SALSA XML format is a lightweight version of TIGER/SALSA XML designed for manual annotation with an XML editor rather than a special tool. Both formats can deal with underspecification, roles crossing the sentence boundary, compound splitting, and whole-sentence tags for meta-level comments."

On this basis, we discuss the problems of vagueness and ambiguity in semantic annotation."
