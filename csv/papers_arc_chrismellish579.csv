Clark and Marshall (1981) introduce two categories of common ground: personal common ground shared by a small group of individuals and communal common ground shared by a community of people. We are most interested in the concept of communal common ground, which arises from the exposure to the same information within a community. For example, if there is a statue in front of your work place, you expect your colleagues to also know about this statue and so the information that there is a statue in front of you workplace becomes a part of the community knowledge (where the community are people who work at the same place).

We call a system developed according to this model a Programmable Instrumented Generator (PIG). Although a PIG could be designed and implemented from scratch, it is likely that researchers would also want to create PIGs based on existing systems. We therefore propose an approach to instrumenting an NLG system so as to make it PIG-like. To experiment with the idea, we have produced code to support the instrumenting of any NLG system written in Java. We report on initial experiments with instrumenting two existing systems and attempting to tune them to produce text satisfying complex stylistic constraints."

As such, semantic web technology has potential to support the exchange and processing of complex NLG data. This paper discusses one particular approach to data sharing and exchange that was developed for NLG - the RAGS framework. This was developed independently of the semantic web. RAGS was relatively complex and involved a number of idiosyncratic features. However, we present a rational reconstruction of RAGS in terms of semantic web concepts, which yields a relatively simple approach that can exploit semantic web technology directly. Given that RAGS was motivated by the concerns of the NLG community, it is perhaps remarkable that its aspirations seem to fit so well with semantic web technology."

Building on what has been discovered in previous experiments, we present a new experiment which does demonstrate such effects. This represents an important step towards the empirical evaluation of affective NLG systems."

We estimate empirically which is the most promising metric and how useful this metric is using a general methodology applied on several corpora. Our main result is that the simplest metric (which relies exclusively on NOCB transitions) sets a robust baseline that cannot be outperformed by other metrics which make use of additional centering-based features. This baseline can be used for the development of both text-to-text and concept-to-text generation systems.

For this, a tool is needed that facilitates easy creation of RDF by non-experts, to enable researchers to deposit and describe their own data.

In this research we confine ourselves to descriptive texts. We examine the occurrence of anaphora in human-generated text and those generated by a hypothetical computer equipped with anaphor generation rules, assuming that the computer can generate the same texts as the human except that anaphora are generated by the rules. A sequence of rules using independently motivated linguistic constraints is developed until the results obtained are close to those in the real texts. The best rule obtained for the choice of anaphor type makes use of the following conditions: locality between anaphor and antecedent, syntactic constraints on zero anaphora, discourse segment structures, salience of objects and animacy of objects. We further establish a rule for choosing descriptions if a nominal anaphor is decided on. We have implemented the above rules in a Chinese natural language generation system that is able to generate descriptive texts. We sent some generated texts to a number of native speakers of Chinese and compared human-created results and computer-generated text to investigate the quality of the generated anaphora. The results of the comparison show that the rules are fairly effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora in Chinese."
W96-0404,Approximate Generation from Non-Hierarchical Representations,1996,23,20,2,0,50070,nicolas nicolov,Eighth International Natural Language Generation Workshop,0,"This paper presents a technique for sentence generation. We argue that the input to generators should have a non-hierarchical nature. This allows us to investigate a more general version of the sentence generation problem where one is not pre-committed to a choice of the syntactically prominent elements in the initial semantics. We also consider that a generator can happen to convey more (or less) information than is originally specified in its semantic input. In order to constrain this approximate matching of the input we impose additional restrictions on the semantics of the generated sentence. Our technique provides flexibility to address cases where the entire input cannot be precisely expressed in a single sentence. Thus the generator does not rely on the strategic component having linguistic knowledge. We show clearly how the semantic structure is declaratively related to linguistically motivated syntactic representation. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Natural language generation is the process of realising communicative intentions as text (or speech). The generation task is standardly broken down into the following processes: content determination (what is the meaning to be conveyed), sentence planning 1 (chunking the meaning into sentence sized units, choosing words), surface realisation (determining the syntactic structure), morphology (inflection of words), synthesising speech or formatting the text output. In this paper we address aspects of sentence planning (how content words are chosen but not how the sem.untics is chunked in units realisable Supported by Faculty of Science and Engineering Scholarship 343 EE06006 at the University of Edinburgh. 1Note that this does not involve planning mechanisms! as sentences) and surface realisation (how syntactic structures are computed). We thus discuss what in the literature is sometimes referred to as tactical generation, that is how to say i t--as opposed to strategic generation--what to say. We look at ways of realising a nonhierarchical semantic representation as a sentence, and explore the interactions between syntax and semantics. Before giving a more detailed description of our proposals first we motivate the nonhierarchical nature of the input for sentence generators and review some approaches to generation from non-hierarchical representations-semantic networks (Section 2). We proceed with some background about the grammatical framework we will employ--D-Tree Grammars (Section 3) and after describing the knowledge sources available to the generator (Section 4) we present the generation algorithm (Section 5). This is followed by a step by step illustration of the generation of one sentence (Section 6). We then discuss further semantic aspects of the generation (Section 7) and the implementation (Section 8). We conclude with a discussion of some issues related to the proposed technique (Section 9). 2 G e n e r a t i o n f rom NonHie ra rch ica l R e p r e s e n t a t i o n s The input for generation systems varies radically from system to system.

The requirements capture process involves the participation of a wide range of different types of people -- the customer, the salesperson, systems engineers, quality assurance, marketing, and so on. Our aim is to build a Computer-Supported Cooperative Working (CSCW) system which will allow these participants to define an Automatic Test System (ATS) collaboratively by adding data and making changes to an evolving design. The collected information about the design will form a large knowledge pool, all of which is pertinent to the design as a whole, but most of which is irrelevant to any particular person engaged in the design process. We will therefore be using natural language generation (NLG) technology to create documents from the central knowledge pool which are tailored to the particular information needs of the participants. These documents will give the users a snapshot of the developing design and will enable them to see how it can be improved and further developed. This paper gives an introduction to the problem we are tackling and how we are trying to solve it, and argues that combining CSCW for input with NLG for output in this way solves some of the problems which are encountered when trying to use either technology on its own."

J89-4002,Natural Language Generation from Plans,1989,16,46,1,1,37137,chris mellish,Computational Linguistics,0,"This paper addresses the problem of designing a system that accepts a plan structure of the sort generated by AI planning programs and produces natural language text explaining how to execute the plan. We describe a system that generates text from plans produced by the NONLIN planner (Tate 1976).The results of our system are promising, but the texts still lack much of the smoothness of human-generated text. This is partly because, although the domain of plans seems a priori to provide rich structure that a natural language generator can use, in practice a plan that is generated without the production of explanations in mind rarely contains the kinds of information that would yield an interesting natural language account. For instance, the hierarchical organization assigned to a plan is liable to reflect more a programmer's approach to generating a class of plans efficiently than the way that a human would naturally chunk the relevant actions. Such problems are, of course, similar to those that Swartout (1983) encountered with expert systems. In addition, AI planners have a restricted view of the world that is hard to match up with the normal semantics of natural language expressions. Thus constructs that are primitive to the planner may be only clumsily or misleadingly expressed in natural language, and the range of possible natural language constructs may be artificially limited by the shallowness of the planner's representations."
