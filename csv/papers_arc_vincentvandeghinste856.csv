The system is used in an online platform for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). In the original translation process, the appropriate sense of a word was not disambiguated before converting it into a pictograph. This often resulted in incorrect translations. The implementation of a WSD tool provides a better semantic understanding of the input messages."

WordNet linking is a process that can be sped up by the use of computational techniques. Manual evaluations of the partly automatically established synonym set (synset) relations between Dutch and English in Cornetto, a Dutch lexical-semantic database associated with the EuroWordNet grid, have confronted us with a worrisome amount of erroneous links. By extracting translations from various bilingual resources and automatically assigning a confidence score to every pre-established link, we reduce the error rate of the existing equivalence relations between both languagesxe2x80x99 synsets (section 2). We will apply this technique to reuse the connection of Sclera and Beta pictograph sets and Cornetto synsets to Princeton WordNet and other WordNets, allowing us to further extend an existing Dutch text-to-pictograph translation tool to other languages (section 3)."

These tools look for TM sentences highly similar to an input sentence, using edit distance to detect the differences between sentences. Current CAT tools use limited or no linguistic knowledge in this procedure. In the recently started SCATE project, which aims at improving translatorsxe2x80x99 efficiency, we apply syntactic fuzzy matching in order to detect abstract similarities and to increase the number of fuzzy matches. We parse TM sentences in order to create hierarchical structures identifying constituents and/or dependencies. We calculate TER (Translation Error Rate) between an existing human translation of an input sentence and the translation of its fuzzy match in TM. This allows us to assess the usefulness of syntactic matching with respect to string-based matching. First results hint at the potential of syntactic matching to lower TER rates for sentences with a low match score in a string-based setting.

This demonstration paper describes GrETEL, a linguistic search engine ( ) that enables non-technical users to consult treebanks in a user-friendly way. Instead of a formal search expression, a natural language example is used as input to the system, allowing users to search for similar constructions as the example they provide.

However, the exploitation of those treebanks requires knowledge of specific data structures and query languages such as XPath. Linguists who are unfamiliar with formal languages are often reluctant towards learning such a language. In order to make treebank querying more attractive for non-technical users we developed GrETEL (Greedy Extraction of Trees for Empirical Linguistics), a query engine in which linguists can use natural language examples as a starting point for searching the Lassy treebank without knowledge about tree representations nor formal query languages. By allowing linguists to search for similar constructions as the example they provide, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional and computational linguistics. Two case studies are conducted to provide a concrete demonstration of the tool. The architecture of the tool is optimised for searching the LASSY treebank, but the approach can be adapted to other treebank lay-outs."

These issues are of a more cultural nature, and may even come into play when several documents in a single language are involved. We pay special attention to those aspects dealing with the spatiotemporal characteristics of a text. Correct automatic selection of (parts of) texts such as handling the same eventuality, presupposes spatiotemporal disambiguation at a rather specific level. The same holds for the analysis of the query. For generation and translation purposes, spatiotemporal aspects may be relevant as well. At the moment English (both the British and American variants) and Dutch (the Flemish and Dutch variant) are covered, all taking into account the perspective of a contemporary, Flemish user. In our approach the cultural aspects associated with for example the language of publication and the language used by the user play a crucial role."

In part to answer this need, the STEVIN programme was established. To pave the way for the effective building of a 500-million-word reference corpus of written Dutch, a pilot project was established. The Dutch Corpus Initiative project or D-Coi was highly successful in that it not only realized about 10{\%} of the projected large reference corpus, but also established the best practices and developed all the protocols and the necessary tools for building the larger corpus within the confines of a necessarily limited budget. We outline the steps involved in an endeavour of this kind, including the major highlights and possible pitfalls. Once converted to a suitable XML format, further linguistic annotation based on the state-of-the-art tools developed either before or during the pilot by the consortium partners proved easily and fruitfully applicable. Linguistic enrichment of the corpus includes PoS tagging, syntactic parsing and semantic annotation, involving both semantic role labeling and spatiotemporal annotation. D-Coi is expected to be followed by SoNaR, during which the 500-million-word reference corpus of Dutch should be built."

Once tools for a particular language have been developed, it is logical, but not trivial to reuse them for other types or registers of the language than the tools were originally designed for. This paper reviews the decisions and adaptations necessary to make this particular transfer from spoken to written language, focusing on a part-of-speech tagger and a lemmatizer. While the lemmatizer can be transferred fairly straightforwardly, the tagger needs to be adaptated considerably. We show how it can be adapted without starting from scratch.
