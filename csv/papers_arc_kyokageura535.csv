Many institutions and language service providers construct and maintain multilingual terminologies, which constitute important assets. However, the curation of such multilingual resources requires significant human effort; though automatic multilingual term extraction methods have been proposed so far, they are of limited success as term translation cannot be satisfied by simply conveying meaning, but requires the terminologists and domain experts{'} knowledge to fit the term within the existing terminology. Here we propose a method to encode the structural property of a term by aligning their embeddings using graph convolutional networks trained from separate languages. We observe that the structural information can augment the semantic methods also explored in this work, and recognize the unique nature of terminologies allows our method to fully take advantage and produce superior results."

Terminologie et Intelligence Artificielle (atelier TALN-RECITAL {\\textbackslash}{\\&} IC),0,"Terms represent concepts, which consist of conceptual characteristics. In actual concept-term formation, which is done by researchers, the process is in reverse: conceptual elements/characteristics are consolidated to form concepts, which are represented by terms. As concepts do not exist on the fly, what we may call termino-conceptual system provides scaffolding in this process. Terminologists, both in practice and in research, do not only collect and list terms but also analyse, describe and define terms and systematise terminologies. To carry out these tasks, terminologists must refer to conceptual systems, to the extent that they contribute to systematising terminologies; terminologists thus also deal with the sphere of termino-conceptual system. In this paper, we consolidate the status of termino-conceptual sphere and propose a way to characterise the structure of termino-conceptual system by using entropy. The entropic characterisation of English terminologies of six domain, i.e. agriculture, botany, chemistry, computer science, physics and psychology are presented."

Determining concepts represented by terms in political discourse can be considered as a Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task. The analysis of political discourse, however, requires identifying precise concepts of terms from relatively small data. This work attempts to provide a basic framework for revealing concepts of terms in political discourse with explicit contextual information. The framework consists of three parts: 1) extracting important terms, 2) generating concordance for each term with stipulative definitions and explanations, and 3) agglomerating similar information of the term by hierarchical clustering. Utterances made by Prime Minister Abe Shinzo in the Diet of Japan are used to examine our framework. Importantly, we revealed the conceptual inconsistency of the term Sonritsu-kiki-jitai. The framework was proved to work, but only for a small number of terms due to lack of explicit contextual information."

Intrinsic evaluation of the created scheme confirmed its potential contribution to the consistent classification of identified erroneous text spans, achieving visibly higher Cohen{'}s kappa values, up to 0.831, than previous work.

Our method belongs to a {``}generate and validate{''} framework rather than extraction from corpora. Although many studies have proposed methods to find term translations or to augment terminology within a {``}generate and validate{''} framework, few has taken full advantage of the systematic nature of terminologies. A terminology of a domain represents the conceptual system of the domain fairly systematically, and we contend that making use of the systematicity fully will greatly contribute to the effective augmentation of terminologies. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel method to generate bilingual term candidates by using existing terminologies and delving into their systematicity. Experiments have shown that our method can generate much better term candidate pairs than the existing method and give improved performance for terminology augmentation."

To assess the coverage of the terms/concepts in the municipal domain and validate the quality of the control, we employ a quantitative extrapolation method that estimates the potential vocabulary size. Using Large-Number-of-Rare-Event (LNRE) modelling, we compare two parameters: (1) uncontrolled and controlled and (2) Japanese and English. The results show that our terminologies currently cover about 45{--}65{\%} of the terms and 50{--}65{\%} of the concepts in the municipal domain, and are well controlled. The detailed analysis of growth patterns of terminologies also provides insight into the extent to which we can enlarge the terminologies within the realistic range."

Using four MT systems, we tested two sets of writing rules designed for two document types written by authors with contrasting professional profiles.

We seek to address this challenge by investigating the feasibility of de-veloping a xe2x80x98controlled Japanesexe2x80x99 with explicit restrictions on vocabulary, syntax and style ade-quate for authoring technical documentation. Our starting point is sentences extracted from two types of document: consumer user manuals (UM) and company-internal documents articulat-ing the know-how of key employees (KH).

MWUs also play an essential role in organising vocabulary, which is most prominently visible in domain-specific terminologies. There has been, however, a limited and mostly theoretical concern with the latter aspect of MWUs; researchers interested in NLP-related applications of terminologies have not paid sufficient attention to this aspect. In this talk I will start by giving the basic framework within which the study of MWUs from the point of view of vocabulary can be carried out, in the process clarifying the relationships between studies of MWUs in texts and those in relation to vocabulary. I will then introduce some of the theoretical studies in terminological structure which I have carried out in recent years. Referring to some of the problems that practically-oriented research in terminology processing is currently facing, I will argue why, how and in what possible ways the understanding of the roles MWUs take in terminological structure constitute a sin qua non condition for making a breakthrough in current text-oriented studies of terminological MWUs."

The problem is further complicated by the fact that the possible range of idiom variations has not been described in a computationally tractable way.

One of the difficulties of compound noun analysis is that the mechanisms governing the decision system of semantic relations and the representation method of semantic relations associated with lexical and contextual meaning are not obvious. The aim of our research is to clarify how lexical semantics contribute to the relations in compound nouns since such nouns are very productive and are supposed to be governed by systematic mechanisms. The results of applying our approach to the analysis of noun-deverbal compounds in Japanese and English show that lexical conceptual structure contributes to the restrictional rules in compounds.

The experimental evaluation based on compound nouns with deverbal heads showed that over 99% of the compounds were accurately analyzed.

But for Japanese-French pairs, the method is not guaranteed to work, because only a very few Japanese Katakana words are borrowed directly from French. In this paper we will show the possibility of extracting Japanese Katakana and French word pairs based on transliteration from loosely aligned Japanese French bilingual corpora. The method applies all the existing transliteration rules to each mora unit in a Katakana word, and extracts the French word which matches or partially-matches one of these transliteration candidates as translation. For instance, if we have `xe3x82xb0xe3x83xa9xe3x83x95' in the Japanese part of a bilingual corpora, we generate such transliteration candidates as , , ,... and identify similar words from French part of the corpora. The method performed reasonably well, achieving 80% precision at 20% recall. We had also observed that Japanese-English transliteration rules worked well for extracting Katakana-French word pairs."
