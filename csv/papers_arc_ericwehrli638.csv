While several open systems are available for POS-tagging and dependency parsing or terminology extraction, their integration into an application requires some computational competence. Furthermore, none of the parsers/taggers handles MWEs very satisfactorily, in particular when the two terms of the collocation are distant from each other or in reverse order. Our tools, on the other hand, are specifically designed for users with no particular computational literacy. They do not require from the user any download, installation or adaptation if used on-line, and their integration in an application, using one the scripts described below is quite easy. Furthermore, by default, the parser handles collocations and other MWEs, as well as anaphora resolution (limited to 3rd person personal pronouns). When used in the tagger mode, it can be set to display grammatical functions and collocations."

Since existing MT systems incorporate mostly local information, these are arguably ill-suited for handling those collocations whose items are not found in close proximity. In this article, we describe an integrated environment in which collocations (and possibly their translation equivalents) are first identified from text corpora and stored in the lexical database of a translation system, then they are employed by this system, which is capable of dealing with syntactic transformations as it is based on a deep linguistic approach. We compare the performance of our system (in terms of collocation translation adequacy) with that of two major MT systems, one statistical, and the other rule-based. Our results confirm that syntactic variation affects translation quality and show that a deep syntactic approach is more robust in this sense, especially for languages with freer word order (e.g., German) and richer morphology (e.g., Italian) than English."

As the number of necessary bilingual dictionaries is a quadratic function of the number of languages considered, we will face the problem of getting a large number of dictionaries. In this paper we discuss a solution to derive a bilingual dictionary by transitivity using existing ones and to check the generated translations in a parallel corpus. Our first experiments concerns the generation of two bilingual dictionaries and the quality of the entries are very promising. The number of generated entries could however be improved and we conclude the paper with the possible ways we plan to explore."

In this latter case, the parser makes a provisional interpretation, which is checked when the argument structure of the predicate is available. Moreover, a strategy of argument transfer is used in cases of long-distance scrambling, according to which arguments and adjuncts are attached to the domain of the coherent verb, ECM verb, or raising verb, and transferred to the infinitival complement for interpretation."

This paper starts with an overview of the system, discussing some of its basic features as well as its general architecture. We then turn to a more detailed discussion of the right corner parsing strategy developed for this project. Combining top down and bottom up features, this strategy is consistent with an incremental interpretation of sentences."

Based on a GB-inspired parser, lexical transfer and lexical projection, STS provides real-time accurate English translations for a small but non-trivial subset of French sentences."
