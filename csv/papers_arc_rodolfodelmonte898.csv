The paper gives a brief overview of sign languages (SLs) and some peculiarities of SL fables such as the use of space, the strategy of Role Shift and classifiers. It also presents the annotation of the fable {``}The Tortoise and the Hare{''} - signed in LIS and made available by Alba Cooperativa Sociale -, which was annotated manually by first author for her master{'}s thesis. The annotation was the starting point of a generation process that allowed us to automatically generate a text in Italian starting from LIS glosses. LIS sentences have been transcribed with Italian words into tables on simultaneous layers, each of which contains specific linguistic or non-linguistic pieces of information. In addition, the present work discusses problems encountered in the annotation and generation process."

The paper is concerned with syntactic complexity as measurable on the basis of the cognitive parser that incrementally builds up a syntactic representation to be used by the semantic component. The theory behind will be LFG and parsing preferences will be used to justify one choice both from a principled and a processing point of view. LFG is a transformationless theory in which there is no deep structure separate from surface syntactic structure. This is partially in accordance with constructional theories in which noncanonical structures containing non-argument functions FOCUS/TOPIC are treated as multifunctional constituents. Complexity is computed on a processing basis following suggestions made by Blache and demonstrated by Kluender and Chesi"

In addition the system adds syntactic and semantic structural analysis and prosodic modeling. We do a dependency mapping to analyse the verbal complex and determine Discourse Structure. Another important component of the system is a phonological parser to account for OOVWs, in the process of grapheme to phoneme conversion of the poem. We also measure the prosody of the poem by associating mean durational values in msecs to each syllable from a database of syllable durations; to account for missing syllables we built a syllable parser with the aim to evaluate durational values for any possible syllable structure. A fundamental component for the production of emotions is the one that performs affective and sentiment analysis. This is done on a line by line basis. Lines associated to specific emotions are then marked to be pronounced with special care for the final module of the system, which is reponsible for the production of expressive reading by a TTS module, in our case the one made available by Apple on their computers. Expressive reading is allowed by the possibility to interact with the TTS."

We assume that this task requires deep understanding of text and that statistically-based methods, both supervised and unsupervised are inadequate. The reason for this choice is due to the fact that event coreference can only take place whenever argumenthood is properly computed. It is a fact that in many cases, arguments of predicates are implicit and thus linguistically unexpressed. This prevents training to produce sensible results. We also assume that spatiotemporal locations need to be taken into account and this is also very often left implicit. We used GETARUNS system to develop the coreference system which works on the basis of the discourse model and the automatically annotated markables. We present data from the analysis, both on unexpressed implicit arguments and the description of the coreference algorithm."

We refer to Fillmore's theory of pragmatically controlled zero anaphora (Fillmore, 1986), which accounts for the phenomenon of omissible arguments using a lexically-based approach, and we propose a strategy for identifying implicit arguments in a text and finding their antecedents, given the overtly expressed semantic roles in the form of frame elements. To this purpose, we primarily rely on linguistic knowledge enriched with role frequency information collected from a training corpus. We evaluate our approach using the test set developed for the SemEval task 10 and we highlight some issues of our approach. Besides, we also point out some open problems related to the task definition and to the general phenomenon of null instantiated arguments, which needs to be better investigated and described in order to be captured from a computational point of view."

In particular, the idea that the task may be solved by the use of Information Retrieval tools like Bag of Words Approaches (BOWs) is totally flawed. BOWs approaches are sometimes also camouflaged by a keyword based Ontology matching and Concept search, based on such lexica as SentiWordNet, by simply stemming a text and using content words to match its entries and produce some result. Any search based on keywords and BOWs is fatally flawed by the impossibility to cope with such fundamental issues as the following ones: xe2x80xa2 presence of negation at different levels of syntactic constituency; xe2x80xa2 presence of lexicalized negation in the verb or in adverbs; xe2x80xa2 presence of conditional, counterfactual subordinators; xe2x80xa2 double negations with copulative verbs; xe2x80xa2 presence of modals and other modality operators. In order to cope with these linguistic elements we propose to build a Flat Logical Form (FLF) directly from a Dependency Structure representation augmented by indices and where anaphora resolution has operated pronoun-antecedent substitutions. We implemented these additions our the system called venses that we will show. The output of the system is an xml representation where each sentence of a text or dialog is a list of attribute-value pairs, like polarity, attitute and factuality. In order to produce this output, the system makes use of FLF and a vector of semantic attributes associated to the verb at propositional level and then memorized. Important notions required by the computation of opinion and sentiment are also the distinction of the semantic content of each proposition into two separate categories: xe2x80xa2 Objective vs Subjective This distinction is obtained by searching for factivity markers again at propositional level. In particular we take into account: xe2x80xa2 tense; xe2x80xa2 voice; xe2x80xa2 mood; xe2x80xa2 modality operators; xe2x80xa2 modifiers and attributes adjuncts at sentence level; xe2x80xa2 lexical type of the verb (in Levinxe2x80x99s classes and also using WordNet classification).

We will present the adjustments we made in order to cope with transcribed spoken dialogues like those produced in the ICSI Berkeley project.

MorphoPro is the morphological component of TextPro, a suite of tools oriented towards a number of NLP tasks. In order to extend this component to Venetan, we developed a declarative representation of the morphological knowledge necessary to analyze and synthesize Venetan words. This task was challenging for several reasons, which are common to a number of lesser-used languages: although Venetan is widely used as an oral language in everyday life, its written usage is very limited; efforts for defining a standard orthography and grammar are very recent and not well established; despite recent attempts to propose a unified orthography, no Venetan standard is widely used. Besides, there are different geographical varieties and it is strongly influenced by Italian."

In addition, no ontology is needed: semantic relations are derived from linguistic relations encoded in the syntax. The main tenet of the system is that it is possible to produce consistent semantic representations using a strict linguistic approach without resorting to extralinguistic knowledge sources. The paper will briefly present the low level component which is responsible for pronominal binding, quantifier raising and temporal interpretation. Then it will discuss in more detail the high level component where a Discourse Model is created from text. The system has been evaluated on a wide variety of texts from closed domains, producing full and accurate parsing, semantics and anaphora resolution for all sentences."

We will present the low level component organized according to LFG theory. The system also does pronominal binding, quantifier raising and temporal interpretation. Then we will introduce the high level component where the Discourse Model is created from a text. Texts belonging to closed domains are characterized by the fact that their semantics is controlled or under command of the system; and most importantly, sentences making up the texts are fully parsed without failures. In practice, these texts are short and sentences are also below a certain threshold, typically less than 25 words. For longer sentences the system switches from the topdown to the bottomup system. In case of failure it will backoff to the partial system which produces a very lean and shallow semantics with no inference rules. The small text we will present contains what is called a psychological statement sentence which contributes an important bias as to the linking of the free pronominal expression contained in the last sentence."

As manual corpus annotation is expensive and time-consuming, we decided to exploit this existing constituency-based Treebank to derive dependency structures with lower effort. After describing the procedure to extract heads and dependents, based on a head percolation table for Italian, we introduce the rules adopted to add grammatical relation labels. To this purpose, we manually relabeled all non-canonical arguments, which are very frequent in Italian, then we automatically labeled the remaining complements or arguments following some syntactic restrictions based on the position of the constituents w.r.t to parent and sibling nodes. The final section of the paper describes evaluation results. Evaluation was carried out in two steps, one for dependency relations and one for grammatical roles. Results are in line with similar conversion algorithms carried out for other languages, with 0.97 precision on dependency arcs and F-measure for the main grammatical functions scoring 0.96 or above, except for obliques with 0.75."

A second subsystem fires allowed logical and lexical inferences on the basis of different types of structural transformations intended to produce a semantically valid meaning correspondence. In the current challenge, we produced a new version of the system, where we do away with grammatical relations and only use semantic roles to generate weighted scores. We also added a number of additional modules to cope with fine-grained inferential triggers which were not present in previous dataset. Different levels of argumenthood have been devised in order to cope with semantic uncertainty generated by nearly-inferrable Text-Hypothesis pairs where the interpretation needs reasoning. RTE3 has introduced texts of paragraph length: in turn this has prompted us to upgrade VENSES by the addition of a discourse level anaphora resolution module, which is paramount to allow entailment in pairs where the relevant portion of text contains pronominal expressions. We present the system, its relevance to the task at hand and an evaluation."

Statistical techniques have till now outperformed symbolic processing of unrestricted text. However, Information Extraction and Question Answering require by far more accurate results of what is currently produced by Bag-Of-Words approaches. Besides, we see that such tasks as Semantic Evaluation of Text Entailment or Similarity -- as required by the RTE Challenge, impose a much stricter performance in semantic terms to tell true from false pairs. We will speak in favour of a hybrid system, a combination of statistical and symbolic processing with reference to a specific problem, that of Anaphora Resolution which looms large and deep in text processing."

GETARUNS is a symbolic linguistically-based parser written in Prolog Horn clauses which uses a strong deterministic policy by means of a lookahead mechanism and a WFST. The grammar allows the specification of linguistic rules in a highly declarative mode: it works topdown and by making a heavy use of linguistic knowledge may achieve an almost complete deterministic policy: in this sense it is equivalent to an LR parser. The results obtained fare higher that the ones reported in (Preis, 2003) and this we argue is due basically to the symbolic rule-based approach: we reach 96% precision (coverage) and 84% recall (accuracy). We assume that from a psycholinguistic point of view, parsing requires setting up a number of disambiguating strategies, to tell arguments apart from adjuncts and reduce the effects of backtracking. To do that the system is based on LFG theoretical framework and uses Grammatical Functions information to help the parser cope with syntactic ambiguity. In the paper we shall comment on some shortcomings of the Greval corpus annotation and more in general we shall criticize some aspects of the Dependency Structure representation."

We assume that the starting point of any interesting application in these fields must necessarily be a good syntacticsemantic parser. In this paper we present the system for text understanding called GETARUNS, General Text and Reference Understanding System (Delmonte, 2003a). The heart of the system is a rule-based top-down DCG-style parser, which uses an LFG oriented grammar organization. The parser produces an f-structure as a DAG which is then used to create a Logical Form, the basis for all further semantic representation. GETARUNS, has a highly sophisticated linguistically based semantic module which is used to build up the Discourse Model. Semantic processing is strongly modularized and distributed amongst a number of different submodules which take care of Spatio-Temporal Reasoning, Discourse Level Anaphora Resolution."

Most papers present approaches on tagging which are statistically based. None of the statistically based analyses, however, produce an accuracy level comparable to the one obtained by means of linguistic rules [1]. Of course their data are strictly referred to English, with the exception of [2, 3, 4]. As to Italian, we argue that purely statistically based approaches are inefficient basically due to great sparsity of tag distribution xe2x80x93 50% or less of unambiguous tags when punctuation is subtracted from the total count. In addition, the level of homography is also very high: readings per word are 1.7 compared to 1.07 computed for English by [2] with a similar tagset. The current work includes a syntactic shallow parser and a ATN-like grammatical function assigner that automatically classifies previously manually verified tagged corpora. In a preliminary experiment we made with automatic tagger, we obtained 99,97% accuracy in the training set and 99,03% in the test set using combined approaches: data derived from statistical tagging is well below 95% even when referred to the training set, and the same applies to syntactic tagging. As to the shallow parser and GF-assigner we shall report on a first preliminary experiment on a manually verified subset made of 10,000 words."

Two basic claims will be made: i. difficulties in associating grammatical functions to constituent structure can be overcome only if Lexical Theory is adopted as a general theoretical framework, and translated into adequate computational formalisms like ATN or CHART; ii. decisions made at previous point affect focus structure construal rules, which are higher level phonological rules which individuate intonation centre, build up adequate Intonational Groups and assign pauses to adequate sites, all being very sensitive to syntactic and semantic information.We will concentrate on Subject/Object function association to c-structure in Italian, and its relation to ATN formalism, in particular HOLD mechanism and FLAGging.
