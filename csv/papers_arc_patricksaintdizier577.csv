W16-6613,Challenges of Argument Mining: Generating an Argument Synthesis based on the Qualia Structure,2016,0,3,1,1,31571,patrick saintdizier,Proceedings of the 9th International Natural Language Generation conference,0,"Given a controversial issue, argument mining from texts in natural language is extremely challenging: besides linguistic aspects, domain knowledge is often required together with appropriate forms of inferences to identify arguments. A major challenge is then to organize the arguments which have been mined to generate a synthesis that is relevant and usable. We show that the Generative Lexicon (GL) Qualia structure, enhanced in different manners and associated with inferences and language patterns, allows to capture the typical concepts found in arguments and to organize a relevant synthesis."

These documents are designed to be as unambiguous as possible for their users. For international industries based in non-English speaking countries, the professionals in charge of writing requirements are often non-native speakers of English, who rarely receive adequate training in the use of English for this task. As a result, requirements can contain a relatively large diversity of lexical and grammatical errors, which are not eliminated by the use of guidelines from controlled languages. This article investigates the distribution of errors in a corpus of requirements written in English by native speakers of French. Errors are defined on the basis of grammaticality and acceptability principles, and classified using comparable categories. Results show a high proportion of errors in the Noun Phrase, notably through modifier stacking, and errors consistent with simplification strategies. Comparisons with similar corpora in other genres reveal the specificity of the distribution of errors in requirements. This research also introduces possible applied uses, in the form of strategies for the automatic detection of errors, and in-person training provided by certification boards in requirements authoring."

This contribution explores the types of knowledge that are required and how they can be paired with reasoning schemes, language processing and language resources to accurately mine arguments. We show via corpus analysis that the Generative Lexicon, enhanced in different manners and viewed as both a lexicon and a domain knowledge representation, is a relevant approach. In this paper, corpus annotation for argument mining is first developed, then we show how the generative lexicon approach must be adapted and how it can be paired with language processing patterns to extract and specify the nature of arguments. Our approach to argument mining is thus knowledge driven."

This is the LELIO project: producing customized LELIE solutions. Our goal, within the framework of LELIE (a system that tags language uses that do not follow the Constrained Natural Language principles), is to automate the long, costly and error prone lexical customization of LELIE to a given application domain. Technical texts being relatively restricted in terms of syntax and lexicon, results obtained show that this approach is feasible and relatively reliable. By auto-adaptative, we mean that the system learns from a sample of the application corpus the various lexical terms and uses crucial for LELIE to work properly (e.g. verb uses, fuzzy terms, business terms, stylistic patterns). A technical writer validation method is developed at each step of the acquisition."

This paper presents a first step towards the automatic generation of argumentative responses to accompany the corrections proposed by a correction and writing-aid system. This system focuses on pairs of languages (e.g. French speakers writing in English), and incorporates a strong didactic orientation. We show how, in case several corrections are available, error annotations can be used to design argumentations weighing the pros and cons of each correction. Argumentation is paired with decision theory in order to help the user pick out the most appropriate correction. Argumentative responses produced manually are used to create the generation schemas required to implement the automatic generation of such texts in the future."

The author or the generator of instructional texts must follow a number of principles to guarantee that the text is of any use. Similarly, a user must follow step by step the instructions in order to reach the results expected. In this paper, we explore facets of instructional texts: general prototypical structures, rhetorical structure and natural argumentation. Our study is based on an extensive corpus study with the aim of generating such texts. 1 General typology of instructional texts Instructional texts, also equivalently called procedural texts, consist of a sequence of instructions, designed with some accuracy in order to reach an objective (e.g. assemble a computer). Procedural texts explain how to realize a certain goal by means of actions which are at least partially temporally organized. Procedural texts often exhibit a quite complex rational and xe2x80x99irrationalxe2x80x99 structure, outlining different ways to realize something, with arguments, advices, conditions, hypothesis, preferences, evaluations, user stimulations, etc. They also often contain a number of recommendations, warnings, and comments of various sorts. Another feature is that procedural texts tend to minimize the distance between language and action. Plans to realize a goal are made as immediate and explicit as necessary, the objective being to reduce the inferences that the user will have to make before acting, and therefore potential errors or misunderstandings. Texts are thus oriented towards action, they combine instructions with icons, images, graphics, summaries, etc. In our perspective, procedural texts range from apparently simple cooking receipes to large maintenance manuals (whose paper versions are measured in tons e.g. for aircraft maintenance). They also include documents as diverse as teaching texts, medical notices, social behavior recommendations, directions for use, assembly notices, do-it-yourself notices, itinerary guides, advice texts, savoir-faire guides etc. Procedural texts obey more or less to a number of structural criteria, which may depend on the authorxe2x80x99s writing abilities and on traditions associated with a given domain. There is obviously a big contrast between maintenance manuals and people magazines which both contains such texts. Procedural texts can be regulatory, procedural, programmatory, prescriptive, injunctive, or may introduce advices (for social of psychological behavior) (Adam, 2001). The study we present in this paper has three main goals: xe2x80xa2 First, to be able to accurately respond in natural language to How? (procedural) questions (Aouladomar 2005), on the Web or in texts, outlining the structure of a procedure that answers such a question, xe2x80xa2 Next, to be able to select the best text (assuming a single text is selected as a response) w.r.t. the user profile when there are several responses (a frequent phenomenon on the Web), xe2x80xa2 Finally, and for the long term, to be able to merge procedural texts or fragments of procedural texts to construct an optimal text, in terms of level of detail, illustration, etc. Integrating texts is obviouly a long-term challenge. This paper basically relates the structure of instructional texts as they are in French. English translations of examples are just glosses, they are given when space constraints permit. We believe that besides language realization variants, most of the characteristics we present here are language neutral. This study is based on an extensive corpus study, within a language production perspective. This approach allows us to integrate logical, linguistic (e.g. (Moschler, 1985), (Anscombre et al. 1981)) and philosophical views of argumentation. In this paper we first introduce some elements of a general typology of instructional texts, outlining the number of components, rational and irrational, that compose them. We then give the most important structural elements, and the rhetorical structure that characterizes the relations between elements. Finally, we focus on argumentation, a major dimension of instructional texts and we briefly present the forms of arguments which are the most important, and under what constraints they can be generated."
