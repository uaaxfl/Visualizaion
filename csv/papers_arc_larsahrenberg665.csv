One is a human translation (HT) into Swedish, and the other a machine translation (MT). While the comparison is limited to one text, the results are indicative of current limitations in MT."

J13-4009,Generation of Compound Words in Statistical Machine Translation into Compounding Languages,2013,58,9,3,0.518713,634,sara stymne,Computational Linguistics,0,"In this article we investigate statistical machine translation SMT into Germanic languages, with a focus on compound processing. Our main goal is to enable the generation of novel compounds that have not been seen in the training data. We adopt a split-merge strategy, where compounds are split before training the SMT system, and merged after the translation step. This approach reduces sparsity in the training data, but runs the risk of placing translations of compound parts in non-consecutive positions. It also requires a postprocessing step of compound merging, where compounds are reconstructed in the translation output. We present a method for increasing the chances that components that should be merged are translated into contiguous positions and in the right order and show that it can lead to improvements both by direct inspection and in terms of standard translation evaluation metrics. We also propose several new methods for compound merging, based on heuristics and machine learning, which outperform previously suggested algorithms. These methods can produce novel compounds and a translation with at least the same overall quality as the baseline. For all subtasks we show that it is useful to include part-of-speech based information in the translation process, in order to handle compounds."
stymne-ahrenberg-2012-practice,On the practice of error analysis for machine translation evaluation,2012,15,20,2,0.623679,634,sara stymne,Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'12),0,"Error analysis is a means to assess machine translation output in qualitative terms, which can be used as a basis for the generation of error profiles for different systems. As for other subjective approaches to evaluation it runs the risk of low inter-annotator agreement, but very often in papers applying error analysis to MT, this aspect is not even discussed. In this paper, we report results from a comparative evaluation of two systems where agreement initially was low, and discuss the different ways we used to improve it. We compared the effects of using more or less fine-grained taxonomies, and the possibility to restrict analysis to short sentences only. We report results on inter-annotator agreement before and after measures were taken, on error categories that are most likely to be confused, and on the possibility to establish error profiles also in the absence of a high inter-annotator agreement."

The following phenomena are in focus: (i) The most common errors produced by current state-of-the-art MT systems for Polish-English MT. (ii) The effect of different types of errors on text cohesion. (iii) The effect of different types of errors on readers' understanding of the translation. We found that errors of incorrect and missing translations are the most common for current systems, while the category of non-translated words had the most negative impact on comprehension. All three of these categories contributed to the breaking of cohesive chains. The correlation between number of errors found in a translation and number of wrong answers in the comprehension tests was low. Another result was that non-native speakers of English performed at least as good as native speakers on the comprehension tests."

The reordered text is used to create a second word alignment which can be an improvement of the first alignment, since the word order is more similar. The method requires no other pre-processing such as part-of-speech tagging or parsing. We report improved Bleu scores for English-to-German and English-to-Swedish translation. We also examined the effect on word alignment quality and found that the reordering method increased recall while lowering precision, which partly can explain the improved Bleu scores. A manual evaluation of the translation output was also performed to understand what effect our reordering method has on the translation system. We found that where the system employing reordering differed from the baseline in terms of having more words, or a different word order, this generally led to an improvement in translation quality."

For English--German we attempted to improve the translation tables with a combination of standard statistical word alignments and phrase-based word alignments. For German--English translation we tried to make the German text more similar to the English text by normalizing German morphology and performing rule-based clause reordering of the German text. This resulted in small improvements for both translation directions.

In training, two reordering strategies were studied: (i) reorder on the basis of the alignments from Giza, and (ii) reorder by moving all verbs to the end of segments. In translation, out-of-vocabulary words were preprocessed in a knowledge-lite fashion to identify a likely equivalent. All three strategies were implemented for our Englishxe2x86x94German system submitted to the WMT10 shared task. Combining them lead to improvements in both language directions."

We first describe our method for comparison which is based on manually reviewed word alignments. We investigate relative frequences of different types of correspondence, including null alignments, many-to-one correspondences and crossings. In addition, both halves of the parallel corpus have been annotated with morpho-syntactic information. The syntactic annotation uses labelled dependency relations. Thus, we can see how different types of correspondences are distributed on different parts-of-speech and compute correspondences at the structural level. In spite of the fact that two of the other subcorpora contains fiction, it is found that the Europarl part is the one having the highest proportion of many types of restructurings, including additions, deletions, long distance reorderings and dependency reversals. We explain this by the fact that the majority of Europarl segments are parallel translations rather than source texts and their translations."

To address this issue, we have investigated the use of a grammar checker for two purposes in connection with SMT: as an evaluation tool and as a postprocessing tool. To assess the feasibility of the grammar checker on SMT output, we performed an error analysis, which showed that the precision of error identification in general was higher on SMT output than in previous studies on human texts. Using the grammar checker as an evaluation tool gives a complementary picture to standard metrics such as Bleu, which do not account well for grammaticality. We use the grammar checker as a postprocessing tool by automatically applying the error correction suggestions it gives. There are only small overall improvements of the postprocessing on automatic metrics, but the sentences that are affected by the changes are improved, as shown both by automatic metrics and by a human error analysis. These results indicate that grammar checker techniques are a useful complement to SMT."

We focus on two methods to improve the word alignment: (i) by applying Giza in a second phase to a reordered training corpus, where reordering is based on the alignments from the first phase, and (ii) by adding lexical data obtained as high-precision alignments from a different word aligner. These methods were studied in the context of a system that uses compound processing, a morphological sequence model for German, and a part-of-speech sequence model for English. Both methods gave some improvements to translation quality as measured by Bleu and Meteor scores, though not consistently. All systems used both out-of-domain and in-domain data as the mixed corpus had better scores in the baseline configuration."

A qualitative analysis of compound translation shows that decompounding improves translation quality.

Some guidelines for the selection of close translations are proposed and their application on concrete examples drawn from an English-Swedish parallel corpus is discussed. The definition of different quality levels in relation to a high-quality standard is also touched upon."
