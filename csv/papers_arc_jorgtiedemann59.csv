But whether they actually understand the meaning of the processed sequences is still unclear. We propose a new diagnostics test suite which allows to assess whether a dataset constitutes a good testbed for evaluating the models{'} meaning understanding capabilities. We specifically apply controlled corruption transformations to widely used benchmarks (MNLI and ANLI), which involve removing entire word classes and often lead to non-sensical sentence pairs. If model accuracy on the corrupted data remains high, then the dataset is likely to contain statistical biases and artefacts that guide prediction. Inversely, a large decrease in model accuracy indicates that the original dataset provides a proper challenge to the models{'} reasoning capabilities. Hence, our proposed controls can serve as a crash test for developing high quality data for NLI tasks."

Collecting all available parallel data between the languages, we obtain around 30,000 sentence pairs. However, there exists a significantly larger monolingual Northern S{\'a}mi corpus, as well as a rule-based machine translation (RBMT) system between the languages. To make the best use of the monolingual data in a neural machine translation (NMT) system, we use the backtranslation approach to create synthetic parallel data from it using both NMT and RBMT systems. Evaluating the results on an in-domain test set and a small out-of-domain set, we find that the RBMT backtranslation outperforms NMT backtranslation clearly for the out-of-domain test set, but also slightly for the in-domain data, for which the NMT backtranslation model provided clearly better BLEU scores than the RBMT. In addition, combining both backtranslated data sets improves the RBMT approach only for the in-domain test set. This suggests that the RBMT system provides general-domain knowledge that cannot be found from the relative small parallel training data."

These MNMT models are usually trained on English-centric data, i.e. English either as the source or target language, and with a language label prepended to the input indicating the target language. However, recent work has highlighted several flaws of these models in zero-shot scenarios where language labels are ignored and the wrong language is generated or different runs show highly unstable results. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of an explicit alignment to language labels in Transformer-based MNMT models in the zero-shot context, by jointly training one cross attention head with word alignment supervision to stress the focus on the target language label. We compare and evaluate several MNMT systems on three multilingual MT benchmarks of different sizes, showing that simply supervising one cross attention head to focus both on word alignments and language labels reduces the bias towards translating into the wrong language, improving the zero-shot performance overall. Moreover, as an additional advantage, we find that our alignment supervision leads to more stable results across different training runs."

In order to address this issue, we propose a supervised transformation from one into the other using explicit alignment and fine-tuning.

However, to date, these evaluation test sets do not include any training data that would provide a fair setup measuring the sense distributions present within the training data itself. In this paper, we present an evaluation benchmark on WSD for machine translation for 10 language pairs, comprising training data with known sense distributions.

A key feature of the Transformer architecture is the so-called multi-head attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus simultaneously on different parts of the input. However, recent works have shown that most attention heads learn simple, and often redundant, positional patterns. In this paper, we propose to replace all but one attention head of each encoder layer with simple fixed {--} non-learnable {--} attentive patterns that are solely based on position and do not require any external knowledge. Our experiments with different data sizes and multiple language pairs show that fixing the attention heads on the encoder side of the Transformer at training time does not impact the translation quality and even increases BLEU scores by up to 3 points in low-resource scenarios."

In this article, we explore a multilingual translation model capable of producing fixed-size sentence representations by incorporating an intermediate crosslingual shared layer, which we refer to as attention bridge. This layer exploits the semantics from each language and develops into a language-agnostic meaning representation that can be efficiently used for transfer learning. We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks. Similarly, we show that trainable downstream tasks benefit from multilingual models, whereas additional language signals do not improve performance in non-trainable benchmarks. This is an important insight that helps to properly design models for specific applications. Finally, we also include an in-depth analysis of the proposed attention bridge and its ability to encode linguistic properties. We carefully analyze the information that is captured by individual attention heads and identify interesting patterns that explain the performance of specific settings in linguistic probing tasks."

While contextual variation does not always reflect actual meaning shifts, it can still reduce the similarity of embeddings for word instances having the same meaning. We explore the imprint of two specific linguistic alternations, namely passivization and negation, on the representations generated by neural models trained with two different objectives: masked language modeling and translation. Our exploration methodology is inspired by an approach previously proposed for removing societal biases from word vectors. We show that passivization and negation leave their traces on the representations, and that neutralizing this information leads to more similar embeddings for words that should preserve their meaning in the transformation. We also find clear differences in how the respective features generalize across datasets."

We test this hypotheses by measuring the perplexity of such models when applied to paraphrases of the source language. The intuition is that an encoder produces better representations if a decoder is capable of recognizing synonymous sentences in the same language even though the model is never trained for that task. In our setup, we add 16 different auxiliary languages to a bidirectional bilingual baseline model (English-French) and test it with in-domain and out-of-domain paraphrases in English. The results show that the perplexity is significantly reduced in each of the cases, indicating that meaning can be grounded in translation.

J19-2006,What Do Language Representations Really Represent?,2019,21,1,4,0,996,johannes bjerva,Computational Linguistics,0,"A neural language model trained on a text corpus can be used to induce distributed representations of words, such that similar words end up with similar representations. If the corpus is multilingual, the same model can be used to learn distributed representations of languages, such that similar languages end up with similar representations. We show that this holds even when the multilingual corpus has been translated into English, by picking up the faint signal left by the source languages. However, just as it is a thorny problem to separate semantic from syntactic similarity in word representations, it is not obvious what type of similarity is captured by language representations. We investigate correlations and causal relationships between language representations learned from translations on one hand, and genetic, geographical, and several levels of structural similarity between languages on the other. Of these, structural similarity is found to correlate most strongly with language representation similarity, whereas genetic relationships{---}a convenient benchmark used for evaluation in previous work{---}appears to be a confounding factor. Apart from implications about translation effects, we see this more generally as a case where NLP and linguistic typology can interact and benefit one another."

The recently proposed network architecture of the \textit{Transformer} is based entirely on attention mechanisms and achieves new state of the art results in neural machine translation, outperforming other sequence-to-sequence models. However, so far not much is known about the internal properties of the model and the representations it learns to achieve that performance. To study this question, we investigate the information that is learned by the attention mechanism in Transformer models with different translation quality. We assess the representations of the encoder by extracting dependency relations based on self-attention weights, we perform four probing tasks to study the amount of syntactic and semantic captured information and we also test attention in a transfer learning scenario. Our analysis sheds light on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various encoder representations. We observe that specific attention heads mark syntactic dependency relations and we can also confirm that lower layers tend to learn more about syntax while higher layers tend to encode more semantics."

Its underlying idea is to make use of existing tools and annotations in resource-rich languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor languages. Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel corpora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a target language. In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine translation to create synthetic training data from the original source-side annotations. Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing, using a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation. Our approach draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy source-side annotation of an unrelated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers. We show that this approach significantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing.% despite the error-prone translation step."

This study presents the first attempt of jointly performing machine translation and text simplification, which is demonstrated through the case of translating parliamentary texts from English to Swedish."

This is an essential task for enabling future development of discourse-level statistical machine translation, as it allows easy integration of discourse features in the decoding process. We extend the framework of sentence-level feature weight optimization to the document-level. We show experimentally that we can get competitive and relatively stable results when using a standard set of features, and that this framework also allows us to optimize documentlevel features, which can be used to model discourse phenomena."

In our experiments, we find that such characterlevel models cut the number of untranslated words by over 40% and are especially competitive (improvements of 2-3 BLEU points) in the case of limited training data. We explore the impact of character alignment, phrase table filtering, bitext size and the choice of pivot language on translation quality. We further compare cascaded translation models to the use of synthetic training data via multiple pivots, and we find that the latter works significantly better. Finally, we demonstrate that neither word- nor character-BLEU correlate perfectly with human judgments, due to BLEUxe2x80x99s sensitivity to length."

Strong similarities between certain languages make it very hard to classify them correctly using standard methods that have been proposed in the literature. Dedicated models that focus on specific discrimination tasks help to improve the accuracy of general-purpose language identification tools. We propose and compare methods based on simple document classification techniques trained on parallel corpora of closely related languages and methods that emphasize discriminating features in terms of blacklisted words. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques are highly accurate for the difficult task of discriminating between Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian. The best setup yields an absolute improvement of over 9% in accuracy over the best performing baseline using a state-of-the-art language identification tool."

The aligner implements a recurrent architecture for structural prediction using history features and a sequential classification procedure. The discriminative base classifier uses a log-linear model in the current setup which enables simple integration of various features extracted from the data. The Lingua-Align toolbox provides a flexible framework for feature extraction including contextual properties and implements several alignment inference procedures. Various settings and constraints can be controlled via a simple frontend or called from external scripts. Lingua-Align supports different treebank formats and includes additional tools for conversion and evaluation. In our experiments we can show that our tree aligner produces results with high quality and outperforms unsupervised techniques proposed otherwise. It also integrates well with another existing tool for manual tree alignment which makes it possible to quickly integrate additional training material and to run semi-automatic alignment strategies.

We evaluate retrieval performance and the overall QA performance in order to study the impact of the different segmentation approaches. From our experiments we can conclude that the simple techniques using fixed-sized windows clearly outperform the semantically motivated approaches, which indicates that uniformity in size seems to be more important than semantic coherence in our setup."

We investigate whether automatic word-alignment in existing parallel corpora facilitates the classification of candidate expressions along a continuum ranging from literal and transparent expressions to idiomatic and opaque expressions. Our method relies on two criteria: (i) meaning predictability that is measured as semantic entropy and (ii), the overlap between the meaning of an expression and the meaning of its component words. We approximate the mentioned overlap as the proportion of default alignments. We obtain a significant improvement over the baseline with both measures."

Many alignment strategies are based on links between single words.

Word alignment clues indicate associations between words and phrases. They can be based on features such as frequency, part-of-speech, phrase type, and the actual wordform strings. Clues can be found by calculating similarity measures or learned from word aligned data. The clue alignment approach, which is proposed in this paper, makes it possible to combine association clues taking different kinds of linguistic information into account.

The system was developed in a co-operative project between the Department of Linguistics, Uppsala University, the bus and truck manufacturing company Scania CV AB, and the translation company Explicon AB. The focus of the project was the scaling up of MULTRA for translation from Swedish to English in the automotive service domain (Sagvall Hein et al., 2002). The scaling-up effort also implied eliminating separate morphological processing by storing the lexical data in a bi-lingual lexical database with a built-in morphology (Tiedemann, 2002). Here we focus on the transparency aspects of the MATS system. The translation proceeds in a number of distinct steps from an SGML version of the source document to an SGML version of the target document. The output of each step is, optionally, presented to the user for inspection. The transparency of the system is most useful for grammar developers and teaching purposes. Another interface will be developed for end users. MATS runs via a web-based interface, and if a step fails for a certain input, the corresponding part is highlighted in a colour specific to that step. The outcome of the different steps is collected and summarised in an evaluation report. The interface provides a great variety of presentation, tracing, and evaluation options"

Three focal points of the project work have been the design and implementation of the new MATS system, including the redesign, porting and integration of MULTRA, the redesign and implementation of the dictionaries of the language modules as a lexical database, and the scaling up of the dictionaries and the grammars. The system is currently trained on a corpus of aligned bitexts from the automotive service domain. The coverage of the lexical data is almost complete, and validated by professional translators, but the grammars are still limited.
