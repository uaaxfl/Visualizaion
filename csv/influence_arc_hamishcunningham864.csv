Our response to these considerations has been to design and implement a software environment called GATE - a General Architecture for Text Engineering (Cunningham, Gaizauskas, and Wilks, 1995; Cunningham, Wilks, and Gaizauskas, 1996) - which attempts to meet the following objectives: 1. support information interchange between LE modules at the highest common level possible without prescribing theoretical approach (though it allows modules which share theoretical presuppositions to pass data in a mutually accepted common form); • maturing NLP technology which is now able, for some tasks, to achieve high levels of accuracy repeatedly on real data.

As part of the Verbmobil real-time speech-to-speech translation project ICE has addressed two key problems for this type of system, viz. distributed processing and incremental interpretation (Gorz et al., 1996): distribution to contribute to processing speed in what is a very compute-intensive application area; incremental interpretation both for speed reasons and to facilitate feedback of results from downstream modules to upstream ones (e.g. to inform the selection of word interpretations from phone lattices using partof-speech information). ICE provides a distribution and communication layer based on PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine).

Next we discuss current trends in the field and motivate a set of requirements that have formed the design brief for G A T E , which is then described.

Distributed control is easy to implement in a database-centred system like T I P S T E R - the DB can act as a blackboard, and implementations can take advantage of well-understood access control (locking) technology. How to do distributed control in LT-NSL is not obvious. We plan to provide this type of control in G A T E via collaboration with the Corelli project at CRL, New Mexico - see (Zajac, 1997) for more details. 2.5 Combining Addition and Reference We believe the above comparison demonstrates that there are significant advantages to the T I P S T E R model and it is this model that we have chosen for GATE. We also believe that SGML and the T E I must remain central to any serious text processing strategy. 240 The points above do not contradict this view, but indicate that SGML should not form the central representation format of every text processing system.

Sentence extraction methods are quite robust, but sentence extracts suffer from lack of cohesion and coherence. Methods that identify the essential information of the document by either information extraction or text understanding and that use the key information to produce a new text, lead to high-quality summarisation (Paice and Jones, 1993; Saggion and Lapalme, 2002) but suffer from the knowledge-bottleneck problem: adapting information extraction rules, templates, and generation grammars to new tasks or domains is time consuming. An alternative to these approaches is to use combination of robust techniques for semantic tagging together with statistical methods (Saggion, 2002). Here, we present a summarisation system that makes use of robust components for semantic tagging and coreference resolution provided by GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002). Our system combines GATE components with well established statistical techniques developed for the purpose of text"

Information extraction and merging from multiple sources has been tried in the past (Radev and McKeown, 1998) but only for single events, the novelty of our approach consists on applying merging to multiple-events extracted from multiple sources. As an example consider the following situation (Netherlands-Yugoslavia match): One of the IE components extracted from document A that in the 30th minute of the match a free-kick was taken, but did not discover who took it.

In contrast, another commonly used strategy, the word based methodology segments a Chinese sentence into the words in a pre-defined word list possibly with probability information about each word, according to some maximum probability criteria ( see e.g. Chen (2003)). The performance of word based segmentation is dependent upon the quality of word list used, while the character based method does not need any word list – it segments a sentence only based on the characters in the sentence. Using character based methodology, we transform the word segmentation problem into four binary classification problems, corresponding to single-character word, the beginning, middle and end character of multi-character word, respectively.

(2002) proposed the Perceptron algorithm with uneven margins (PAUM) by introducing two margin parameters τ+ and τ− into the update rules for the positive and negative examples, respectively. Two margin parameters allow the PAUM to handle imbalanced datasets better than both the standard Perceptron and the margin Perceptron. PAUM has been successfully used for document classification and information extraction (Li et al., 2005). We used the PAUM algorithm to train a classifier for each of four classes for Chinese word segmentation. For one test example, the output of the Perceptron classifier before thresholding was used for comparison among the four classifiers. The important parameters of the learning algorithm are the uneven margins parameters τ + and τ− . In all our experiments τ+ = 20 and τ− = 1 were used.

This kind of strategy has been widely used in the applications of machine learning to named entity recognition and has also 154 been used in Chinese word segmentation (Xue and Shen, 2003). Finally a word delimiter (often a blank space, depending on particular corpus) was added to the right of one character if it was not the last character of a sentence and it was predicted as end character of word or as a single character word. 3 Learning Algorithm Perceptron is a simple and effective learning algorithm.

W02-0108,W02-0109,0,0.302305,"For courses where the emphasis is more on linguistic annotation and corpus work, GATE can be used as a corpus annotation environment (see http://gate.ac.uk/talks/tutorial3/). The annotation can be done completely manually or it can be bootstrapped by running some of GATE’s processing resources over the corpus and then correcting/adding new annotations manually. These facilities can also be used in courses and assignments where the students need to learn how to create data for quantitative evaluation of NLP systems. If evaluated against the requirements for teaching environments discussed in (Loper and Bird, 2002), GATE covers them all quite well. The graphical development environment and the JAPE language facilitate otherwise difficult tasks. Inter-module consistency is achieved by using the annotations model to hold language data, while extensibility and modularity are the very reason why GATE has been successfully used in many research projects (Maynard et al., 2000). In addition, GATE also offers robustness and scalability, which allow students to experiment with big corpora, such as the British National Corpus (approx. 4GB). In the following subsections we will provide further detail about these a"

The classes to be learnt (e.g., Person, Organisation) are provided as part of the user profile, which can be edited on a dedicated page. All ML methods compatible with OLLIE have a uniform way of describing attributes and classes (see Section 3.1 for more details on the ML integration); this makes possible the use of a single user interface for all the ML algorithms available. The fine-tuning parameters are specific to each ML method and, although the ML methods can be run with their default parameters, as established by (Daelemans and Hoste, 2002), substantial variation in performance can be obtained by changing algorithm options. The graphical interface facilities provided by a web browser could be used to design an interface for annotating documents but that would mean stretching them beyond their intended use and it is hard to believe that such an interface would rate very high on a usability scale. In order to provide a more ergonomic interface, OLLIE uses a Java applet that integrates seamlessly with the page displayed by the browser. Apart from better usability, this allows for greater range of options for the user. Since OLLIE n"

The learning algorithms for IE can be classified broadly into two main categories: rule learning and statistical learning. The former induces a set of rules from training examples. There are many rule based learning systems, e.g. SRV (Freitag, 1998), RAPIER (Califf, 1998), WHISK (Soderland, 1999), BWI (Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000), and (LP ) 2 (Ciravegna, 2001).

IE systems also differ from each other in the NLP features that they use. These include simple features such as token form and capitalisation information, linguistic features such as part-ofspeech, semantic information from gazetteer lists, and genre-specific information such as document structure.

Section 2 describes the uneven margins SVM and Perceptron algorithms. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 discuss the classifier-based framework for IE and the experimental datasets we used, respectively. We compare our systems to other state-of-the-art systems on three benchmark datasets in Section 3.3. Section 3.4 discusses the effects of the uneven margins parameter on the SVM and Perceptron’s performances. Finally, Section 4 provides some conclusions. 2 Uneven Margins SVM and Perceptron Li and Shawe-Taylor (2003) introduced an uneven margins parameter into the SVM to deal with imbalanced classification problems. They showed that the SVM with uneven margins outperformed the standard SVM on document classification problem with imbalanced training data. Formally, given a training set Z = ((x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )),where xi is the ndimensional input vector and yi (= +1 or −1) its label, the SVM with uneven margins is obtained by solving the quadratic optimisation problem: minw, b, ξ hw, wi + C m X i=1 ξi s.t. hw, xi i + ξi + b ≥ 1 if yi = +1 3 Experiments hw, xi i − ξi + b ≤ −τ if yi = −1 3.1 ξi ≥ 0"

Implementing a Sense Tagger m m m m m m m m m II senses in texts. A natural extension to this observation is to create a disambiguation system which makes use of several of these independent knowledge sources and combines their results in an intelligent way. Our system is based on a set of partial taggers, each of which uses a different knowledge source, with their results being combined. Our system is in the tradition of McRoy (McRoy, 1992), who also made use of several knowledge sources for word sense disambiguation, although the information sources she used were not independent, making it difficult to evaluate the contribution of each component. Our system makes use of strictly independent knowledge sources and is implemented within GATE whose plug-and-play architecture makes the evaluation of individual components more straightforward. At the moment the sense tagger consists of six stages (shown in figure 6), the first two preprocess the text which is to be disambiguated while the remaining four carry out the disambiguation."

The graphs currently make two main contributions to the system: they give a graphical representation of control flow, and allow the user to manipulate execution of modules; they give a graphical entry point to results visualisation. These benefits will have to be balanced against their disadvantages in future versions of the Cunningham, Stevenson and Wilks II 69 system. Another problem may arise when the architecture includes facilities for distributed processing (Zajac et al., 1997; Zajac, 1997), as it is not obvious how the linear model currently embodied in the graphs could be extended to support non-linear control strucures. 8 Conclusion The previous section indicates that GATE version 1 goes a long way to meeting it's design goals (noted in section 2). The reuse of components we have experienced in the sense tagging project and a number of other local and collaborative projects is in itself justification of the development effort spent on the system, and, hopefully, these savings will be multiplied accross other users of the system.
