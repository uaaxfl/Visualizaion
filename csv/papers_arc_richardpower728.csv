This task raises interesting issues of content planning. One approach, useful as a baseline, is simply to list the subset of axioms relevant to inferring the entailment; however, in many cases it will still not be obvious, even to OWL experts, why the entailment follows. We suggest an approach in which further statements are added in order to construct a proof tree, with every step based on a relatively simple deduction rule of known difficulty; we also describe an empirical study through which the difficulty of these simple deduction patterns has been measured."
J12-1004,Generating Numerical Approximations,2012,18,20,1,1,41078,richard power,Computational Linguistics,0,"We describe a computational model for planning phrases like more than a quarter and 25.9 per cent which describe proportions at different levels of precision. The model lays out the key choices in planning a numerical description, using formal definitions of mathematical form (e.g., the distinction between fractions and percentages) and roundness adapted from earlier studies. The task is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem, with solutions subsequently ranked by preferences (e.g., for roundness). Detailed constraints are based on a corpus of numerical expressions collected in the NumGen project,1 and evaluated through empirical studies in which subjects were asked to produce (or complete) numerical expressions in specified contexts."
W11-2811,Deriving rhetorical relationships from semantic content,2011,16,5,1,1,41078,richard power,Proceedings of the 13th {E}uropean Workshop on Natural Language Generation,0,"This paper investigates to what extent rhetorical relations can be assigned purely on the basis of propositional content, without any reference to speaker goals or other pragmatic information. This task confronts any NLG system designed to generate coherent text from a set of formally represented statements; we consider it here in the context of an ontology verbaliser, for which the input is a set of axioms encoded in the web ontology language OWL. A simple set-theoretical model of the possible semantic relationships between two statements is proposed; this model allows 46 logically consistent relationships, of which we hypothesise that 11 are rhetorically coherent. This hypothesis is tested through an empirical survey which also provides evidence on how the coherent patterns are expressed linguistically."
W11-2821,Levels of organisation in ontology verbalisation,2011,17,11,3,1,41079,sandra williams,Proceedings of the 13th {E}uropean Workshop on Natural Language Generation,0,"The SWAT Tools ontology verbaliser generates a hierarchically organised hypertext designed for easy comprehension and navigation. The document structure, inspired by encyclopedias and glossaries, is organised at a number of levels. At the top level, a heading is generated for every concept in the ontology; at the next level, each entry is subdivided into logically-based headings like 'Definition' and 'Examples'; at the next, sentences are aggregated when they have parts in common; at the lowest level, phrases are hyperlinked to concept headings. One consequence of this organisation is that some statements are repeated because they are relevant to more than one entry; this means that the text is longer than one in which statements are simply listed. This trade-off between organisation and brevity is investigated in a user study."

However, many people find it difficult to understand, particularly people with poor education and disabilities. Sometimes numerical information is presented with hedges that modify the meaning. A numerical hedge is a word or phrase employed to indicate explicitly that some loss of precision has taken place (e.g., around) and it may also indicate the direction of approximation (e.g., more than). This paper presents a study of the use of numerical hedges that is part of research investigating the process of rewriting difficult numerical expressions in simpler ways. We carried out a survey in which experts in numeracy were asked to simplify a range of proportion expressions and analysed the results to obtain guidelines for automating the simplification task."
W10-4222,Grouping Axioms for More Coherent Ontology Descriptions,2010,10,14,2,1,41079,sandra williams,Proceedings of the 6th International Natural Language Generation Conference,0,"Ontologies and datasets for the Semantic Web are encoded in OWL formalisms that are not easily comprehended by people. To make ontologies accessible to human domain experts, several research groups have developed ontology verbalisers using Natural Language Generation. In practice ontologies are usually composed of simple axioms, so that realising them separately is relatively easy; there remains however the problem of producing texts that are coherent and efficient. We describe in this paper some methods for producing sentences that aggregate over sets of axioms that share the same logical structure. Because these methods are based on logical structure rather than domain-specific concepts or language-specific syntax, they are generic both as regards domain and language."

We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers."
williams-power-2010-fact,A Fact-aligned Corpus of Numerical Expressions,2010,10,0,2,1,41079,sandra williams,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'10),0,"We describe a corpus of numerical expressions, developed as part of the NUMGEN project. The corpus contains newspaper articles and scientific papers in which exactly the same numerical facts are presented many times (both within and across texts). Some annotations of numerical facts are original: for example, numbers are automatically classified as round or non-round by an algorithm derived from Jansen and Pollmann (2001); also, numerical hedges such as ÂaboutÂ or Âa little underÂ are marked up and classified semantically using arithmetical relations. Through explicit alignment of phrases describing the same fact, the corpus can support research on the influence of various contextual factors (e.g., document position, intended readership) on the way in which numerical facts are expressed. As an example we present results from an investigation showing that when a fact is mentioned more than once in a text, there is a clear tendency for precision to increase from first to subsequent mentions, and for mathematical level either to remain constant or to increase."

Current approaches to this task assume that axioms in OWL can be mapped to sentences in English. We examine three potential problems with this approach (concerning logical sophistication, information structure, and size), and show that although these could in theory lead to insuperable difficulties, in practice they seldom arise, because ontology developers use OWL in ways that favour a transparent mapping. This result is evidenced by an analysis of patterns from a corpus of over 600,000 axioms in about 200 ontologies."

Several groups are pursuing approaches based on Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs), so that editing can be performed by typing in sentences which are automatically interpreted as statements in OWL. We suggest here a variant of this approach which relies entirely on Natural Language Generation (NLG), and propose requirements for a system that can reliably generate transparent realisations of statements in Description Logic."

Indeed, within the same document, a quantity is often described vaguely in some places and more accurately in others. Vague descriptions tend to occur early in a document and to be expressed in simpler mathematical forms (e.g., fractions or ratios), whereas more accurate descriptions of the same proportions tend to occur later, often expressed in more complex forms (e.g., decimal percentages). Our results can be used in Natural Language Generation (1) to generate repeat descriptions within the same document, and (2) to generate descriptions of numerical quantities for different audiences according to mathematical ability."

The scope of the system is restricted to controlled natural language, and this allows the generator to work within a tightly restricted domain of locality. We can exploit this feature of the system to ensure fast and efficient generation, and also to make the generator reliable by providing a rapid algorithm which can exhaustively test at compile time the completeness of the linguistic resources with respect to the range of potential meanings. The system can be exported for deployment with a minimal build of the semantic and linguistic resources that is verified to ensure that no run-time errors will result from missing resources. The framework is targeted at using natural language generation technology to build semantic web applications where machine-readable information can be automatically expressed in natural language on demand."

In a previous empirical study (Williams and Reiter, 2003) of the RST-DT (Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank) Corpus (Carlson et al., 2003), we noticed that certain rhetorical relations tended to occur more frequently at higher levels in a rhetorical structure tree, whereas others seemed to occur more often at lower levels. The present study takes a closer look at the data, partly to test this observation, and partly to investigate related issues such as the relative complexity of satellite and nucleus for each type of relation. One practical application of this investigation would be to guide discourse planning in Natural Language Generation (NLG), so that it reflects more accurately the structures found in documents written by human authors. We present our preliminary findings and discuss their relevance for discourse planning."
W07-2314,Abstract verbs,2007,8,7,1,1,41078,richard power,Proceedings of the Eleventh {E}uropean Workshop on Natural Language Generation ({ENLG} 07),0,"Existing generation systems use verbs almost exclusively to describe actions/events or to ascribe properties. In doing so, they achieve a direct concrete style of the kind often recommended in style manuals. However in many genres, including academic writing, it is common to find verbs expressing abstract relationships, with events etc. pushed down into nominalisations. This paper illustrates two important classes of abstract verb, one expressing discourse relations, the other expressing participant roles, and discusses some theoretical and practical reasons for studying such verbs and including them in generation systems."

We describe a pilot system for communicating the contents of electronic health records (EHRs) to patients. It generates two alternative presentations, which we have compared in a preliminary evaluation study: the first takes the form of a monologue, which elaborates the information taken from the patient's EHR by adding explanations of some concepts and procedures; the second takes the form of a scripted dialogue, in which the content is recast as a series of questions, answers and statements assigned to two characters in the dialogue, a senior and a junior nurse. Our discourse planning method designs these presentations in tandem, first producing a monologue plan which is then elaborated into a dialogue plan."

The method, based on Conceptual Authoring, is targeted at question-answering systems where reliability and transparency are critical, and where users cannot be expected to undergo extensive training in question composition. This scenario is found in most corporate domains, especially in applications that are risk-averse. We present a proof-of-concept system we have developed: a question-answering interface to a large repository of medical histories in the area of cancer. We show that the method allows users to successfully and reliably compose complex queries with minimal training."

We argue that text and sentence planning need to be driven in part by the goal of maintaining referential continuity and thereby facilitating pronoun resolution: Obtaining a favorable ordering of clauses, and of arguments within clauses, is likely to increase opportunities for nonambiguous pronoun use. Centering theory provides the basis for such an integrated approach. Generating coherent texts according to centering theory is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem. The well-known Rule 2 of centering theory is reformulated in terms of a set of constraintsxe2x80x94cohesion, salience, cheapness, and continuityxe2x80x94and we show sample outputs obtained under a particular weighting of these constraints. This framework facilitates detailed research into evaluation metrics and will therefore provide a productive research tool in addition to the immediate practical benefit of improving the fluency and readability of generated texts. The technique is generally applicable to natural language generation systems, which perform hierarchical text structuring based on a theory of coherence relations with certain additional assumptions."

From this xe2x80x98master modelxe2x80x99, specialised models for a range of document types are derived automatically; from each specialised model, documents are generated automatically in all supported languages.

Almost all work on this problem assumes, implicitly or explicitly, that this mapping is governed by a constraint on compatibility of structure. We show how this constraint can be stated precisely, and present some counterexamples which seem acceptable even though they violate compatibility. The examples are based on a phenomenon we call extraposition, in which complex embedded constituents of a rhetorical structure are extracted and realized separately."
