However, the presence of overlap between the train and test datasets can lead to inflated results, inadvertently evaluating the model{'}s ability to memorize and interpreting it as the ability to generalize. In addition, such data sets may not provide an effective indicator of the performance of these methods in real world scenarios. We identify leakage of training data into test data on several publicly available datasets used to evaluate NLP tasks, including named entity recognition and relation extraction, and study them to assess the impact of that leakage on the model{'}s ability to memorize versus generalize."

Further investigation reveals that if the data distribution of unlabelled sentence pairs is closer to the test data, we can obtain better performance. By leveraging a large general-purpose STS dataset and small-scale in-domain training data, we obtain further improvements to r= 0.90, a new SOTA."

Building on BERT, we study the impact of a number of model design choices, namely different fine-tuning and pooling strategies. We observe that the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on clinical STS is much less than that in the general domain, likely due to the concept richness of the domain. Based on this, we propose two data augmentation techniques. Experimental results on N2C2-STS 1 demonstrate substantial improvements, validating the utility of the proposed methods."

We compare word embeddings pre-trained on biomedical and chemical patent corpora. The effect of tokenizers optimized for the chemical domain on NER performance in chemical patents is also explored. The results on two patent corpora show that contextualized word representations generated from ELMo substantially improve chemical NER performance w.r.t. the current state-of-the-art.

Regarding the question of general principles of test suite construction, we compared this test suite to a named entity recognition test suite constructor. We found that they had twenty features in total and that seven were shared between the two models, suggesting that there is a core of feature types that may be applicable to test suite construction for any similar type of application."

Our methodology involved using the OpenDMAP semantic parser with manually-written rules. We achieved state-of-the-art precision for two of the three tasks, scoring the highest of 24 teams at precision of 71.81 on Task 1 and the highest of 6 teams at precision of 70.97 on Task 2.n n The OpenDMAP system and the rule set are available at bionlp.sourceforge.net."
