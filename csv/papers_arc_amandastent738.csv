We present a detailed account of the entire data collection and annotation processes. The annotations have a very high inter-annotator agreement (0.87 k-alpha). We analyze the data in terms of label distributions, part of speech tags, and sentence lengths. We characterize the performance of various classification algorithms on this dataset and perform ablation studies to understand the nature of the linguistic models suitable for capturing the nuances of the embedded discourse structures in the presented corpus."

For a given document, the generator produces a sequence of keyphrases, and the discriminator distinguishes between human-curated and machine-generated keyphrases. We evaluated this approach on standard benchmark datasets. We observed that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the generation of abstractive keyphrases and is comparable to the best performing extractive techniques. Although we achieve promising results using GANs, they are not significantly better than the state-of-the-art generative models. To our knowledge, this is one of the first works that use GANs for keyphrase generation. We present a detailed analysis of our observations and expect that these findings would help other researchers to further study the use of GANs for the task of keyphrase generation."

Previous works utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) to understand the reasoning ability of models, mostly focusing on high resource languages like English. To address scarcity of data in low-resource languages such as Hindi, we use data recasting to create NLI datasets for four existing text classification datasets. Through experiments, we show that our recasted dataset is devoid of statistical irregularities and spurious patterns. We further study the consistency in predictions of the textual entailment models and propose a consistency regulariser to remove pairwise-inconsistencies in predictions. We propose a novel two-step classification method which uses textual-entailment predictions for classification task. We further improve the performance by using a joint-objective for classification and textual entailment. We therefore highlight the benefits of data recasting and improvements on classification performance using our approach with supporting experimental results."

After these calls, analysts often change their price target recommendations, which are used in equity re- search reports to help investors make deci- sions. In this paper, we examine analysts{'} decision making behavior as it pertains to the language content of earnings calls. We identify a set of 20 pragmatic features of analysts{'} questions which we correlate with analysts{'} pre-call investor recommendations. We also analyze the degree to which semantic and pragmatic features from an earnings call complement market data in predicting analysts{'} post-call changes in price targets. Our results show that earnings calls are moderately predictive of analysts{'} decisions even though these decisions are influenced by a number of other factors including private communication with company executives and market conditions. A breakdown of model errors indicates disparate performance on calls from different market sectors."

Prediction of voting behavior of politicians for whom no voting record exists, such as individuals running for office, is important for forecasting key political decisions. Prior work has relied on past votes cast to predict future votes, and thus fails to predict voting patterns for politicians without voting records. We address this by augmenting a prior state of the art model with multiple sources of external knowledge so as to enable prediction on unseen politicians. The sources of knowledge we use are news text and Freebase, a manually curated knowledge base. We propose augmentations based on unigram features for news text, and a knowledge base embedding method followed by a neural network composition for relations from Freebase. Empirical evaluation of these approaches indicate that the proposed models outperform the prior system for politicians with complete historical voting records by 1.0{\%} point of accuracy (8.7{\%} error reduction) and for politicians without voting records by 33.4{\%} points of accuracy (66.7{\%} error reduction). We also show that the knowledge base augmented approach outperforms the news text augmented approach by 4.2{\%} points of accuracy."

Additional human evaluation demonstrates that the supervised approach also performs competitively with a commercial system that uses more sophisticated features."

For example, using a telephone-based interactive response system a US-based user can find flights from United (1-800-UNITED-1), get movie schedules (1-800-777-FILM), or get bus information (Black et al., 2011). These systems save companies money and help users access information 24/7. However, the interaction between user and system is tightly constrained. For the most part, each system only deals with one domain, so the task models are typically flat slot-filling models (Allen et al., 2001b). Also, the dialogs are very structured, with system initiative and short user responses, giving limited scope to study important phenomena such as coreference."

This system is intended to be a minimal system in the sense that it uses (almost) no lexical, syntactic or semantic information other than that found in the training corpus itself. The system architecture was motivated by work done on FERGUS (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000). The system uses three information sources, each acquired from the training corpus: is a localized tree model capturing information from the dependency tree; a trigram language model capturing word order information for words in the same subtree; and a morphological dictionary. In the sections below we briefly present each of these models."

The subfield of surface realisation has perhaps come closest, but at present we still lack a basis on which different surface realisers could be compared, chiefly because of the wide variety of different input representations used by different realisers. This paper outlines an idea for a shared task in surface realisation, where inputs are provided in a common-ground representation formalism which participants map to the types of input required by their system. These inputs are derived from existing annotated corpora developed for language analysis (parsing etc.). Outputs (realisations) are evaluated by automatic comparison against the human-authored text in the corpora as well as by human assessors."
W09-3921,Concept Form Adaptation in Human-Computer Dialog,2009,13,6,2,0,33730,svetlana stoyanchev,Proceedings of the {SIGDIAL} 2009 Conference,0,In this work we examine user adaptation to a dialog system's choice of realization of task-related concepts. We analyze forms of the time concept in the Let's Go! spoken dialog system. We find that users adapt to the system's choice of time form. We also find that user adaptation is affected by perceived system adaptation. This means that dialog systems can guide users' word choice and can adapt their own recognition models to gain improved ASR accuracy.

We evaluate concept type classification and LM adaptation for post-confirmation utterances in the Let's Go! dialog system. We achieve 93% accuracy on concept type classification using acoustic, lexical and dialog history features. We also show that the use of concept type classification for LM adaptation can lead to improvements in speech recognition performance."

In an experiment using spoken business listing name queries from a business directory assistance service, we achieve a 16.8% absolute improvement in recognition accuracy and a 3-fold speedup in recognition time with geocentric language models when compared with a nationwide language model."
