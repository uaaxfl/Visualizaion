The data for this shared task is provided in three different languages - English, Hindi, and Bengali.

NLP and Computer Vision communities often leverage only one prominent modality in isolation to study social media. However, computational processing of Internet memes needs a hybrid approach. The growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter further suggests that we can not ignore such multimodal content anymore. To the best of our knowledge, there is not much attention towards meme emotion analysis. The objective of this proposal is to bring the attention of the research community towards the automatic processing of Internet memes. The task Memotion analysis released approx 10K annotated memes- with human annotated labels namely sentiment(positive, negative, neutral), type of emotion(sarcastic,funny,offensive, motivation) and their corresponding intensity. The challenge consisted of three subtasks: sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) analysis of memes,overall emotion (humor, sarcasm, offensive, and motivational) classification of memes, and classifying intensity of meme emotion. The best performances achieved were F1 (macro average) scores of 0.35, 0.51 and 0.32, respectively for each of the three subtasks."

CM is quite prevalent in social media conversations in multilingual regions like - India, Europe, Canada and Mexico. In this paper, we explore the problem of Language Modeling (LM) for code-mixed Hinglish text. In recent times, there have been several success stories with neural language modeling like Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) (Radford et al., 2019), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al., 2018) etc.. Hence, neural language models have become the new holy grail of modern NLP, although LM for CM is an unexplored area altogether. To better understand the problem of LM for CM, we initially experimented with several statistical language modeling techniques and consequently experimented with contemporary neural language models. Analysis shows switching-points are the main challenge for the LMCM performance drop, therefore in this paper we introduce the idea of minority positive sampling to selectively induce more sample to achieve better performance. On the contrary, all neural language models demand a huge corpus to train on for better performance. Finally, we are reporting a perplexity of 139 for Hinglish (Hindi-English language pair) LMCM using statistical bi-directional techniques."

There are various types of anti-social behavior in social media. Foremost of them is aggressive behavior, which is causing many social issues such as affecting the social lives and mental health of social media users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based architecture to automatically identify and classify aggressive tweets. Tweets are classified into three categories - Covertly Aggressive, Overtly Aggressive, and Non-Aggressive. The proposed architecture is an ensemble of smaller subnetworks that are able to characterize the feature embeddings effectively. We demonstrate qualitatively that each of the smaller subnetworks is able to learn unique features. Our best model is an ensemble of Capsule Networks and results in a 65.2{\%} F1 score on the Facebook test set, which results in a performance gain of 0.95{\%} over the TRAC-2018 winners.

Different techniques are employed, including a simple unsupervised dictionary-based approach, supervised word-level classification with and without contextual clues, and sequence labelling using Conditional Random Fields. We find that the dictionary-based approach is surpassed by supervised classification and sequence labelling, and that it is important to take contextual clues into consideration."

To overcome the problems of the present proximity-based static sentiment lexicon techniques, the paper proposes a new way to represent sentiment knowledge in a Vector Space Model. This model can store dynamic prior polarity with varying contextual information. The representation of the sentiment knowledge in the Conceptual Spaces of distributional Semantics is termed Sentimantics."

Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users'. The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem.

SemanticNet is the attempt to capture wide range of context dependent semantic inference among various themes which human beings perceive in their pragmatic knowledge, learned by day to day cognitive interactions with the surrounding physical world. SemanticNet holds human pragmatics with twenty well established semantic relations for every pair of lexemes.
