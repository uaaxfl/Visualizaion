The FEVEROUS shared task introduces a benchmark for fact verification, in which a system is challenged to verify the given claim using the extracted evidential elements from Wikipedia documents. In this paper, we propose our 3rd place three-stage system consisting of document retrieval, element retrieval, and verdict inference for the FEVEROUS shared task. By considering the context relevance in the fact extraction and verification task, our system achieves 0.29 FEVEROUS score on the development set and 0.25 FEVEROUS score on the blind test set, both outperforming the FEVEROUS baseline."

In this paper, we address these problems by proposing cross-encyclopedia entity embedding. Unlike other works, our proposed method does not rely on known cross-language pairs.

We propose an unsupervised opinion word translation disambiguation scoring method using dependency distance and feature-opinion association as weighting factors. The scores of an opinion word's translation and its surrounding words' translations are estimated using Google snippets.

In the ranking task, the ranking model is defined as a function of the properties of the objects as well as the relations between the objects.

The idea is to take each retrieved document as a pseudo-IR system. Each document generates a pseudo-ranked list by a global function. The data fusion algorithm is then adapted to generate the final ranked list. Taking a biomedical information extraction task, namely, interactor normalization task (INT), as an example, we explain how the problem can be formulated as a global ranking problem, and demonstrate how the proposed fusion-based framework outperforms baseline methods. By using the proposed framework, we improve the performance of the top 1 INT system by 3.2% using the official evaluation metric of the BioCreAtIvE challenge.

To construct BioProp, a semantic role labeling (SRL) system trained on PropBank is used to annotate BioProp. Incorrect tagging results are then corrected by human annotators. To suit the needs in the biomedical domain, we modify the PropBank annotation guidelines and characterize semantic roles as components of biological events. The method can substantially reduce annotation efforts, and we introduce a measure of an upper bound for the saving of annotation efforts. Thus far, the method has been applied experimentally to a 4,389-sentence tree-bank corpus for the construction of BioProp. Inter-annotator agreement measured by kappa statistic reaches .95 for combined decision of role identification and classification when all argument labels are considered.

Second, we use our proposition bank to train a biomedical SRL system, which uses a maximum entropy (ME) machine-learning model. Thirdly, we automatically generate argument-type templates, which can be used to improve classification of biomedical argument roles. Our experimental results show that a newswire English SRL system that achieves an F-score of 86.29% in the newswire English domain can maintain an F-score of 64.64% when ported to the biomedical domain.
