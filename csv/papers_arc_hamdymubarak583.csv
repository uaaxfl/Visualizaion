In this paper, we present a method for rapidly constructing a tweet dataset containing a wide range of country-level Arabic dialects {---}covering 18 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Our method relies on applying multiple filters to identify users who belong to different countries based on their account descriptions and to eliminate tweets that either write mainly in Modern Standard Arabic or mostly use vulgar language. The resultant dataset contains 540k tweets from 2,525 users who are evenly distributed across 18 Arab countries. Using intrinsic evaluation, we show that the labels of a set of randomly selected tweets are 91.5{\%} accurate. For extrinsic evaluation, we are able to build effective country level dialect identification on tweets with a macro-averaged F1-score of 60.6{\%} across 18 classes."

This allows a user to share their opinions and ideology, especially regarding public content, occasionally adopting offensive language. This may encourage hate crimes or cause mental harm to targeted individuals or groups. Hence, it is important to detect offensive comments in social media platforms. Typically, most studies focus on offensive commenting in one platform only, even though the problem of offensive language is observed across multiple platforms. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce and make publicly available a new dialectal Arabic news comment dataset, collected from multiple social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. We follow two-step crowd-annotator selection criteria for low-representative language annotation task in a crowdsourcing platform. Furthermore, we analyze the distinctive lexical content along with the use of emojis in offensive comments. We train and evaluate the classifiers using the annotated multi-platform dataset along with other publicly available data.

In this work, we present a unified character level sequence-to-sequence deep learning model that recovers both types of diacritics without the use of explicit feature engineering. Specifically, we employ a standard neural machine translation setup on overlapping windows of words (broken down into characters), and then we use voting to select the most likely diacritized form of a word. The proposed model outperforms all previous state-of-the-art systems. Our best settings achieve a word error rate (WER) of 4.49{\%} compared to the state-of-the-art of 12.25{\%} on a standard dataset."

We employed a case-specific correction approach that handles specific error types such as dialectal word substitution and word splits and merges with the aid of a language model. We also applied corrections that are specific to second language learners that handle erroneous preposition selection, definiteness, and gender-number agreement."

The recent SemEval-2015 introduced a shared task on community question answering, providing a corpus and evaluation scheme. In this paper we address the problem of answer selection in Arabic. Our proposed model includes a manifold of features including lexical and semantic similarities, vector representations, and rankings. We investigate the contribution of each set of features in a supervised setting. We show that employing a feature combination by means of a linear support vector machine achieves a better performance than that of the competition winner (F1 of 79.25 compared to 78.55)."

We apply a supervised machine learning approach considering a manifold of features including among others word n-grams, text similarity, sentiment analysis, the presence of specific words, and the context of a comment. Our approach was the best performing one in the Arabic subtask and the third best in the two English subtasks."

We mapped information of user locations to one of the Arab countries, and extracted tweets that have dialectal word(s). Manual evaluation of the extracted corpus shows that the accuracy of assignment of tweets to some countries (like Saudi Arabia and Egypt) is above 93% while the accuracy for other countries, such Algeria and Syria is below 70%."

We employed two correction models, namely a character-level model and a casespecific model, and two punctuation recovery models, namely a simple statistical model and a CRF model. Our results on the development set suggest that using a cascaded correction model yields the best results."

The system performs: correction of common spelling errors pertaining to different forms of alef, ta marbouta and ha, and alef maqsoura and ya; context sensitive word segmentation into underlying clitics, POS tagging, and gender and number tagging of nouns and adjectives. We introduce the use of stem templates as a feature to improve POS tagging by 0.5{\textbackslash}{\%} and to help ascertain the gender and number of nouns and adjectives. For gender and number tagging, we report accuracies that are significantly higher on previously unseen words compared to a state-of-the-art system."

However, most previous work was done on a standard fairly homogeneous dataset of dialectal user comments. In this paper, we show that training on the standard dataset does not generalize, because a unigram model may be tuned to topics in the comments and does not capture the distinguishing features of dialects. We show that effective dialect identification requires that we account for the distinguishing lexical, morphological, and phonological phenomena of dialects. We show that accounting for such can improve dialect detection accuracy by nearly 10% absolute."
2014.iwslt-papers.1,Advances in dialectal {A}rabic speech recognition: a study using {T}witter to improve {E}gyptian {ASR},2014,-1,-1,2,0,12956,ahmed ali,Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation: Papers,0,"This paper reports results in building an Egyptian Arabic speech recognition system as an example for under-resourced languages. We investigated different approaches to build the system using 10 hours for training the acoustic model, and results for both grapheme system and phoneme system using MADA. The phoneme-based system shows better results than the grapheme-based system. In this paper, we explore the use of tweets written in dialectal Arabic. Using 880K Egyptian tweets reduced the Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) rate from 15.1{\%} to 3.2{\%} and the WER from 59.6{\%} to 44.7{\%}, a relative gain 25{\%} in WER."
