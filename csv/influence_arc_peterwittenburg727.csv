The systems takes advantage of the information extracted from formal texts (e.g., lists of players) in order to carry out the analysis of tickers. 3 Merging or Cross-document Event Coreference The merging component in MUMIS combines the partial information as extracted from various sources, such that more complete annotations can be obtained. Information extraction and merging from multiple sources has been tried in the past (Radev and McKeown, 1998) but only for single events, the novelty of our approach consists on applying merging to multiple-events extracted from multiple sources. As an example consider the following situation (Netherlands-Yugoslavia match): One of the IE components extracted from document A that in the 30th minute of the match a free-kick was taken, but did not discover who took it. It did find the names of two players, though: Mihajlovic (a Yugoslavian player) and Van der Sar (the Dutch keeper). From document B a save in the 31st minute was extracted by the IE component, and the names of the same two players were re"

NLI methods are particularly relevant for languages with a significant number of foreign speakers, most notably, English. It is estimated that the number of non-native speakers of English outnumbers the number of native speakers by two to one (Lewis et al., 2013). The written production of non-native speakers is abundant on the Internet, academia, and other contexts where English is used as lingua franca. This study presents the system that participated in the 2013 NLI Shared Task (Tetreault et al., 2013) under the name Cologne-Nijmegen. The novel aspect of the system is the use of TF-IDF weighting schemes. For this study, we experimented with a number of algorithms and features. Linear SVM and logistic regression achieved the best accuracies on the combined features of unigrams and bigrams of words. The rest of the paper will explain in detail the features, methods and results achieved. 2 Motivation There are two main reasons to study NLI.

One of the SLA theories that investigate these phenomena is contrastive analysis, which is used to explain why some structures of L2 are more difficult to acquire than others (Lado, 1957). Contrastive analysis postulates that the difficulty in mastering L2 depends on the differences between L1 and L2. In the process of acquiring L2, language transfer (also known as L1 interference) occurs and speakers apply knowledge from their native language to a second language, taking advantage of their similarities. Computational methods applied to L2 written production can function as a corpus-driven m"
