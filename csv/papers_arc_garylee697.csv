We propose to use only in-domain (IND) sentences to build a generative adversarial network (GAN) of which the discriminator generates low scores for OOD sentences. To improve basic GANs, we apply feature matching loss in the discriminator, use domain-category analysis as an additional task in the discriminator, and remove the biases in the generator. Thereby, we reduce the huge effort of collecting OOD sentences for training OOD detection. For evaluation, we experimented OOD detection on a multi-domain dialog system. The experimental results showed the proposed method was most accurate compared to the existing methods."

Fifteen students tested our system; they gave it higher approval scores than they gave other systems.

To follow counseling techniques, we extracted 5W1H information and user emotions from user utterances, and we generated system utterances while using the counseling techniques. We used the conditional random field algorithm to extract 5W1H information, and constructed our counseling algorithm using a dialog strategy that was based on counseling techniques. A total of 16 adults tested our system and rated it with a higher score as an interactive communicator compared with the baseline system."

The HDM-based MDSF statistically detects one or more candidate domains and heuristically determines one or more final domains from among the candidate domains. The HDM is used in both the candidate domain detection and final domain determination components. Multi-domain dialog systems that employ the HDM-based MDSF provide service to one or more domains at the same time, whereas traditional multi -domain dialog systems provide service to only one domain at a time. To validate the HDM-based MDSF, we developed a multi-domain dialog system for TV program, video-on-demand, and TV device domains. The experimental results show that the HDM-based MDSF correctly selects one or more domains and enables multi-domain dialog systems to provide more accurate and rapid dialog service than traditional multi-domain dialog systems."

A key challenge for Open IE is to achieve self-supervision, in which the training examples are automatically obtained. Although the feasibility of Open IE systems has been demonstrated for English, utilizing such techniques to build the systems for other languages is problematic because previous self-supervision approaches require language-specific knowledge. To improve the cross-language portability of Open IE systems, this paper presents a self-supervision approach that exploits parallel corpora to obtain training examples for the target language by projecting the annotations onto the source language. The merit of our method is demonstrated using a Korean Open IE system developed without any language-specific knowledge."

We demonstrate that our method achieves dramatic speedup on six standard natural language processing problems."

Our method leverages labeled data in the Switchboard-DAMSL and the Meeting Recorder Dialog Act database and applies simple domain adaptation techniques over a large amount of unlabeled email and forum data to address this problem. Our method uses automatically extracted features such as phrases and dependency trees, called subtree features, for semi-supervised learning. Empirical results demonstrate that our model is effective in email and forum speech act recognition."

Many techniques for simulating users and errors have been proposed for use in improving and evaluating spoken dialog systems, but most of them are not easily applied to various dialog systems or domains because some are limited to specific domains or others require heuristic rules. In this paper, we propose a highly-portable technique for simulating user intention, utterance and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) channels. This technique can be used to rapidly build a dialog simulation system for evaluating spoken dialog systems. We propose a novel user intention modeling and generating method that uses a linear-chain conditional random field, a data-driven domain specific user utterance simulation method, and a novel ASR channel simulation method with adjustable error recognition rates. Experiments using these techniques were carried out to evaluate the performance and behavior of previously developed dialog systems designed for navigation dialogs, and it turned out that our approach is easy to set up and shows the similar tendencies of real users."

We suggest an improved syllable-based model and a new semantic-oriented approach to correct both semantic and lexical errors, which is also more accurate for especially domain-specific speech error correction.

This paper presents a syllable-pattern-based generalized unknown-morpheme-estimation method with POSTAG (POStech TAGger), which is a statistical and rule-based hybrid POS tagging system. This method of guessing unknown morphemes is based on a combination of a morpheme pattern dictionary that encodes general lexical patterns of Korean morphemes with a posteriori syllable trigram estimation. The syllable trigrams help to calculate lexical probabilities of the unknown morphemes and are utilized to search for the best tagging result. This method can guess the POS tags of unknown morphemes regardless of their numbers and/or positions in an eojeol (a Korean spacing unit similar to an English word), which is not possible with other systems for tagging Korean. In a series of experiments using three different domain corpora, the system achieved a 97% tagging accuracy even though 10% of the morphemes in the test corpora were unknown. It also achieved very high coverage and accuracy of estimation for all classes of unknown morphemes."

Then, it gives scores to the adjacent content words that are closely related with each answer candidate. Next, it stores the weighted content words with each candidate into a database. Using this technique, along with a complementary analysis of questions, the proposed QA system can save response time because it is not necessary for the QA system to extract answer candidates with scores on retrieval time. If the QA system is combined with a traditional Information Retrieval system, it can improve the document retrieval precision for closed-class questions after minimum loss of retrieval time."
