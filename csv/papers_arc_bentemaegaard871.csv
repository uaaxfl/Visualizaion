It supports the use and study of language data in general and aims to increase the potential for comparative research of cultural and societal phenomena across the boundaries of languages and disciplines, all in line with the European agenda for Open Science. Data infrastructures such as CLARIN have recently embarked on the emerging frameworks for the federation of infrastructural services, such as the European Open Science Cloud and the integration of services resulting from multidisciplinary collaboration in federated services for the wider SSH domain. In this paper we describe the interoperability requirements that arise through the existing ambitions and the emerging frameworks. The interoperability theme will be addressed at several levels, including organisation and ecosystem, design of workflow services, data curation, performance measurement and collaboration."

It supports the study of language data in general and aims to increase the potential for comparative research of cultural and societal phenomena across the boundaries of languages. This paper outlines the CLARIN vision and strategy, and it explains how the design and implementation of CLARIN are compliant with the FAIR principles: findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of data. The paper also explains the approach of CLARIN towards the enabling of responsible data science. Attention is paid to (i) the development of measures for increasing the transparency and explainability of the results from applying CLARIN technologies, in particular in the context of multidisciplinary research, and (ii) stimulating the uptake of its resources, tools and services by the various communities of use, all in accordance with the principles for Open Science."
L16-1072,Providing a Catalogue of Language Resources for Commercial Users,2016,0,2,1,1,17554,bente maegaard,Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'16),0,"Language resources (LR) are indispensable for the development of tools for machine translation (MT) or various kinds of computer-assisted translation (CAT). In particular language corpora, both parallel and monolingual are considered most important for instance for MT, not only SMT but also hybrid MT. The Language Technology Observatory will provide easy access to information about LRs deemed to be useful for MT and other translation tools through its LR Catalogue. In order to determine what aspects of an LR are useful for MT practitioners, a user study was made, providing a guide to the most relevant metadata and the most relevant quality criteria. We have seen that many resources exist which are useful for MT and similar work, but the majority are for (academic) research or educational use only, and as such not available for commercial use. Our work has revealed a list of gaps: coverage gap, awareness gap, quality gap, quantity gap. The paper ends with recommendations for a forward-looking strategy."

Unlike some other language based infrastructures CLARIN-DK is not solely a repository for upload and storage of data, but also a platform of web services permitting the user to process data in various ways. This involves considerable complications in relation to workflow requirements. The CLARIN-DK interface must guide the user to perform the necessary steps of a workflow; even when the user is inexperienced and perhaps has an unclear conception of the requested results. This paper describes a user driven approach to creating a user interface specification for CLARIN-DK. We indicate how different user profiles determined different crucial interface design options. We also describe some use cases established in order to give illustrative examples of how the platform may facilitate research."

In the domain of language resources and tools the CLARIN initiative has been funded since 2008 to overcome many of the integration and interoperability hurdles. CLARIN can build on knowledge and work from many projects that were carried out during the last years and wants to build stable and robust services that can be used by researchers. Here service centres will play an important role that have the potential of being persistent and that adhere to criteria as they have been established by CLARIN. In the last year of the so-called preparatory phase these centres are currently developing four use cases that can demonstrate how the various pillars CLARIN has been working on can be integrated. All four use cases fulfil the criteria of being cross-national."

The project has three streams of activity: the technical stream, the cooperation stream and the dissemination stream. MEDAR has first updated the existing surveys and BLARK for Arabic, and then the technical stream focused on machine translation. The consortium identified a number of freely available MT systems and then customized two versions of the famous MOSES package. The Consortium addressed the needs to package MOSES for English to Arabic (while the main MT stream is on Arabic to English). For performance assessment purposes, the partners produced test data that allowed carrying out an evaluation campaign with 5 different systems (including from outside the consortium) and two online ones. Both the MT baselines and the collected data will be made available via ELRA catalogue. The cooperation stream focuses mostly on the cooperation roadmap for Human Language Technologies for Arabic. Cooperation Roadmap for the region directed towards the Arabic HLT in general. It is the purpose of the roadmap to outline areas and priorities for collaboration, in terms of collaboration between EU countries and Arabic speaking countries, as well as cooperation in general: between countries, between universities, and last but not least between universities and industry."

A very important part of the MEDAR project is to reinforce and extend the NEMLAR network and to create a cooperation roadmap for Human Language Technologies for Arabic. It is expected that the cooperation roadmap will attract wide attention from other parties and that it can help create a larger platform for collaborative projects. Finally, the project will focus on dissemination of knowledge about existing resources and tools, as well as actors and activities; this will happen through newsletter, website and an international conference which will follow up on the Cairo conference of 2004. Dissemination to user communities will also be important, e.g. through participation in translators? conferences. The goal of these activities is to create a stronger and lasting collaboration between EU countries and Arabic speaking countries."

We report on the feedback of post-editors using fluency/adequacy evaluation and the evaluation metric 'Usability', understood in this context as where users on a three point scale evaluate the sentence from the point of view of the post-editor. The post-editor profile defined by the LSP is based on the experiences of introducing MT in the LSP workflow. The relation between the Translation Edit Rate (TER) scores and 'Usability' scores is tested. We find TER a candidate for an automatic metric simulating the post-editors' usability judgements. LSP tests show 67% saved time in post-editing for the tested domain. Finally, the use of weighted sub-domain phrase tables in a SMT system is shown to improve translation quality."

Introduction After considering the strategic and infrastructural role of Language Resources (LRs) within any Human Language Technology (HLT) application (section 1), we focus on the main issues discussed within the ENABLER (European National Activities for Basic Language Resources) Thematic Network (section 2): the survey of LRs, interoperability and multilinguality, open access to LRs, validation methodologies for LRs, industrial and basic requirements. Finally, few recommendations are provided towards the design of general strategies and an overall coordination for the field of LRs (section 3). 1. The Strategic Role of LRs Language Resources (LRs) xe2x80x93 Written, Spoken and, recently, Multimodal xe2x80x93 are a central and strategic component of the so-called xe2x80x9clinguistic infrastructurexe2x80x9d (the other key element being Evaluation), necessary for the development of any Human Language Technology (HLT) application and product. The availability of adequate LRs for as many languages as possible is a pre-requisite for the development of a truly multilingual Information Society. They play a critical role, as horizontal technology, in different areas of the 6 Framework Programme, and have been recognized as a priority within a number of national projects around Europe. The availability of LRs is also a xe2x80x9csensitivexe2x80x9d issue, touching directly the sphere of linguistic and cultural identity, but also with economical, societal and political implications. This is going to be even more true in the new Europe with 25 languages on a par. The ENABLER Thematic Network of HLT National Projects in European countries xe2x80x93 an EC funded IST project, designed and started by Antonio Zampolli, with a clear strategic vision for the field of LRs xe2x80x93 is the first broad European initiative which has the mission of explicitly considering together the technical, organizational, strategic and political issues of LRs. In ENABLER these various aspects are put together in a coherent framework, to set up mediumand long-term set of priorities (both technical and strategic) and to promote these at the national and international levels. Moreover, ENABLER has recognized the importance to promote actions aiming at integrating the different resource types, until now developed independently, and xe2x80x93 as a consequence xe2x80x93 at promoting the cooperation between the communities of Speech, Text and Multimodality. In the following we briefly highlight the main issues tackled by ENABLER on the different layers. 2. The Main Issues 2.1. The Survey of LRs The ENABLER Consortium conducted the Survey of LRs to get a global picture of the situation on LRs, in order to be able to compare the various conditions that hold across different languages and xe2x80x93 on this basis xe2x80x93 to suggest more"

Much the same holds for analysts working on more technical aspects of environmental issues. In preparing studies, the technical analyst can draw upon extensive bodies of existing work undertaken elsewhere that might contain useful information or insights. When the characteristics and results of previous studies are broadly similar, especially in terms of the problems considered and the approaches used, one question is whether this material can be systematically processed to generate comprehensive and concise conclusions that may be transferable to other areas of work. If this is so, then rather than performing an additional new in-depth study, it may be possible to elicit relevant information by looking at earlier studies dealing with similar questions."
