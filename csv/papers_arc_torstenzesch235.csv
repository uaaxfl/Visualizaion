2021.unimplicit-1.2,Implicit Phenomena in Short-answer Scoring Data,2021,-1,-1,3,0,656,marie bexte,Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Understanding Implicit and Underspecified Language,0,"Short-answer scoring is the task of assessing the correctness of a short text given as response to a question that can come from a variety of educational scenarios. As only content, not form, is important, the exact wording including the explicitness of an answer should not matter. However, many state-of-the-art scoring models heavily rely on lexical information, be it word embeddings in a neural network or n-grams in an SVM. Thus, the exact wording of an answer might very well make a difference. We therefore quantify to what extent implicit language phenomena occur in short answer datasets and examine the influence they have on automatic scoring performance. We find that the level of implicitness depends on the individual question, and that some phenomena are very frequent. Resolving implicit wording to explicit formulations indeed tends to improve automatic scoring performance."

As an extreme example, up to 60{\%} of adversarial answers generated from random shuffling of words in real answers are accepted by a state-of-the-art scoring system. In addition to analyzing the vulnerabilities of content scoring systems, we examine countermeasures such as adversarial training and show that these measures improve system robustness against adversarial answers considerably but do not suffice to completely solve the problem."

The resulting proposition evaluation dataset allows us to independently compare the performance of proposition extraction systems on simple and complex clauses. Although performance drastically drops on more complex sentences, we show that the same systems perform best on both simple and complex clauses.

In this article, we analyze which Twitter posts could actually be deemed offenses under German criminal law. German law follows the deductive method of the Roman law tradition based on abstract rules as opposed to the inductive reasoning in Anglo-American common law systems. This allows us to show how legal conclusions can be reached and implemented without relying on existing court decisions. We present a data annotation schema, consisting of a series of binary decisions, for determining whether a specific post would constitute a criminal offense. This schema serves as a step towards an inexpensive creation of a sufficient amount of data for an automated classification. We find that the majority of posts deemed offensive actually do not constitute a criminal offense and still contribute to public discourse. Furthermore, laymen can provide sufficiently reliable data to an expert reference but are, for instance, more lenient in the interpretation of what constitutes a disparaging statement."

We evaluate a wide range of approaches on a crowdsourced data set containing over 100,000 judgments on over 2,000 assertions.

However, an individualxe2x80x99s position on a controversial issue is often not just a binary support-or-oppose stance on the issue, but rather a conglomerate of nuanced opinions and beliefs on various aspects of the issue. These opinions and beliefs are often expressed qualitatively in free text in issue-focused surveys or on social media. However, quantifying vast amounts of qualitative information remains a significant challenge. The goal of this work is to provide a new approach for quantifying qualitative data for the understanding of controversial issues. First, we show how we can engage people directly through crowdsourcing to create a comprehensive dataset of assertions (claims, opinions, arguments, etc.) relevant to an issue. Next, the assertions are judged for agreement and strength of support or opposition, again by crowdsourcing. The collected Dataset of Nuanced Assertions on Controversial Issues (NAoCI dataset) consists of over 2,000 assertions on sixteen different controversial issues. It has over 100,000 judgments of whether people agree or disagree with the assertions, and of about 70,000 judgments indicating how strongly people support or oppose the assertions. This dataset allows for several useful analyses that help summarize public opinion. Across the sixteen issues, we find that when people judge a large set of assertions they often do not disagree with the individual assertions that the opposite side makes, but that they differently judge the relative importance of these assertions. We show how assertions that cause dissent or consensus can be identified by ranking the whole set of assertions based on the collected judgments. We also show how free-text assertions in social media can be analyzed in conjunction with the crowdsourced information to quantify and summarize public opinion on controversial issues."

While preparation effort for these tests is low, scoring needs to be done manually, as there usually is a huge number of correct solutions. In this paper, we examine whether the ambiguity of cloze items can be lowered to a point where automatic scoring becomes possible. We utilize the local context of a word to collect evidence of low-ambiguity. We do that by seeking for collocated word sequences, but also taking structural information on sentence level into account. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in a user study on cloze items ranked by our method. For the top-ranked items (lowest ambiguity) the subjects provide the target word significantly more often than for the bottom-ranked items (59.9% vs. 36.5%). While this shows the potential of our method, we did not succeed in fully eliminating ambiguity. Thus, further research is necessary before fully automatic scoring becomes possible."

We propose to employ context-sensitive lexical inference rules in order to generate distractors that are semantically similar to the gap target word in some sense, but not in the particular sense induced by the gap-fill context. We hypothesize that such distractors should be particularly hard to distinguish from the correct answer. We focus on verbs as they are especially difficult to master for language learners and find that our approach is quite effective. In our test set of 20 items, our proposed method decreases the number of invalid distractors in 90% of the cases, and fully eliminates all of them in 65%. Further analysis on that dataset does not support our hypothesis regarding item difficulty as measured by average error rate of language learners.

DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported."

Thus, cognates are important indicators for the prediction of the perceived difficulty of a text. We introduce a method for automatic cognate production using character-based machine translation. We show that our approach is able to learn production patterns from noisy training data and that it works for a wide range of language pairs. It even works across different alphabets, e.g. we obtain good results on the tested language pairs English-Russian, English-Greek, and English-Farsi. Our method performs significantly better than similarity measures used in previous work on cognates."

For that purpose, we extract naturally occurring errors and their contexts from the Wikipedia revision history. We show that such natural errors are better suited for evaluation than the previously used artificially created errors. In particular, the precision of statistical methods has been largely over-estimated, while the precision of knowledge-based approaches has been under-estimated. Additionally, we show that knowledge-based approaches can be improved by using semantic relatedness measures that make use of knowledge beyond classical taxonomic relations. Finally, we show that statistical and knowledge-based methods can be combined for increased performance."

Text reuse is traditionally detected by computing similarity between a source text and a possibly reused text. However, existing text similarity measures exhibit a major limitation: They compute similarity only on features which can be derived from the content of the given texts, thereby inherently implying that any other text characteristics are negligible. In this paper, we overcome this traditional limitation and compute similarity along three characteristic dimensions inherent to texts: content, structure, and style. We explore and discuss possible combinations of measures along these dimensions, and our results demonstrate that the composition consistently outperforms previous approaches on three standard evaluation datasets, and that text reuse detection greatly benefits from incorporating a diverse feature set that reflects a wide variety of text characteristics."

Specifically, we use a distributional thesaurus, computed from a large parsed corpus, for lexical expansion of context and sense information. This bridges the lexical gap that is seen as the major obstacle for word overlapxe2x80x90based approaches. We apply this mechanism to two traditional knowledge-based methods and show that distributional information significantly improves disambiguation results across several data sets.

Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia's edit history."

As most studies only use a certain Wikipedia snapshot, the influence of WikipediaÂs massive growth on the results is largely unknown. For the first time, we perform an in-depth analysis of this influence using semantic relatedness as an example application that tests a wide range of WikipediaÂs properties. We find that the growth of Wikipedia has almost no effect on the correlation of semantic relatedness measures with human judgments, while the coverage steadily increases."

Collaborative knowledge bases however significantly differ from traditional linguistic knowledge bases in various respects, and this constitutes both an asset and an impediment for research in NLP. This paper addresses one such major impediment, namely the lack of suitable programmatic access mechanisms to the knowledge stored in these large semantic knowledge bases. We present two application programming interfaces for Wikipedia and Wiktionary which are especially designed for mining the rich lexical semantic information dispersed in the knowledge bases, and provide efficient and structured access to the available knowledge. As we believe them to be of general interest to the NLP community, we have made them freely available for research purposes."
