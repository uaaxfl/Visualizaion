Our system uses a hierarchy of reinforcement learning dialogue agents, which support transitions across sub-dialogues in order to relax the strictness of hierarchical control and therefore support flexible interactions. We demonstrate our system with the Nao robot playing two versions of a Quiz game. Whilst language input and dialogue control is autonomous or wizarded, language output is provided by the robot combining verbal and non-verbal contributions. The novel features in our system are (a) the flexibility given to users to navigate flexibly in the interaction; and (b) a framework for investigating adaptive and flexible dialogues."

This problem ca nb e addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate an approximate tru ev alue function, or by using ah ierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. In this paper, we present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of hierarchical control with function approximation. The approach incorporates two concepts to allow flexible switching between subdialogues, extending current hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. First, hierarchical treebased state representations initially represent a compact portion of the possible state space and are then dynamically extended in real time. Second, we allow state transitions across sub-dialogues to allow non-strict hierarchical control. Our approach is integrated, and tested with real users, in a robot dialogue system that learns to play Quiz games."

One prerequisite for this is that the robot can correctly identify objects or places a user refers to, and produce comprehensible references itself. As robots typically act in environments that are larger than what is immediately perceivable, the problem arises how to identify the appropriate context, against which to resolve or produce a referring expression (RE). Existing algorithms for generating REs generally bypass this problem by assuming a given context. In this paper, we explicitly address this problem, proposing a method for context determination in large-scale space. We show how it can be applied both for resolving and producing REs."

One sub-group of the subjects was presented with a highly formalized presentation consisting mainly of formulas, while the other with a presentation mainly in natural language. Our goal was to obtain more data on the kind of mixed-language that is characteristic of informal mathematical discourse.

The overall aim of this work is to learn when and how to best employ different types of clarification strategies in multimodal dialogue systems. This paper describes a framework for learning multimodal clarification strategies for an in-car MP3 music player dialogue system. The framework consists of three major parts. First we collect data on multimodal clarification strategies in a wizard-of-oz study. Second we extract feature in the stateaction space to learn an initial policy from this data. Third we specify a reward function to refine that policy using extensions of existing evaluation schemes.

In contrast to other projects in which information structure is annotated and investigated (e.g. in the Prague Dependency Treebank, which mirrors the basic information about the topic-focus articulation of the sentence), we do not annotate theory-biased categories like topic-focus or theme-rheme. Trying to be as theory-independent as possible, we annotate those features which are relevant to information structure and on the basis of which typical patterns, co-occurrences or correlations can be determined. We distinguish between three annotation levels: syntax, discourse and prosody. The data is based on the TIGER Corpus for German and the Penn Treebank for English, since the existing information on part-of-speech and syntactic structure can be re-used for our purposes. The actual annotation of an English example sequence illustrates our choice of categories on each level. Their combination offers the possibility to investigate how information structure is realised and can be interpreted."
