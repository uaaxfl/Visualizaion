At a rough estimate, if the number of elements of L3 is one, then the foreseen pronoun can be synthesized since it does not lead to ambiguity, while it should not be synthesized if the number of elements in L3 is greater than one since it would lead to ambiguity. Yet, it is well known that pragmatic and structure parallelism considerations may allow a pronoun to be non ambiguous even if L3 has more than one element (G. Hirst 1981, C. Sidner 1981, K.

Since RST is a descriptive theory without any formal background, there exists a wide range of interpretations and several notions of Rhetorical Structure. For some authors, e.g. (Marcu et al., 2000), the Rhetorical Structure is very surfacic: it is an ordered tree isomorphic to the linearized structure of the text and a rhetorical relation can be viewed as a nickname for a small set of cue phrases. For other authors, the rhetorical structure is more abstract: it aims at representing meaning.

In the second one, obtained by adjunct iteration and noted SA2, both Conja S2 and Conjb S3 are adjuncts to S1. Figure 2 shows the derived and derivation trees for these two analyses.

Paris 7 Paris, France djame.seddah@paris-sorbonne.fr benoit.sagot@inria.fr laurence.danlos@linguist.jussieu.fr Abstract In this paper1 we present an extension of MCTAGs with Local Shared Derivation (Seddah, 2008) which can handle non local elliptic coordinations. Based on a model for control verbs that makes use of so-called ghost trees, we show how this extension leads to an analysis of argument cluster coordinations that provides an adequate derivation graph. This is made possible by an original interpretation of the MCTAG derivation tree mixing the views of Kallmeyer (2005) and Weir (1988). 1 Introduction Elliptic coordinate structures are a challenge for most constituent-based syntactic theories. To model such complex phenomena, many works have argued in favor of factorized syntactic structures (Maxwell and Manning, 1996), while others have argued for distributive structures that include a certain amount of non-lexically realized elements (Beavers and Sag, 2004). Of course, the boundary between those two approaches is not sharp since one can decide to first build a factorized syntactic analysis and then construct a more distributive structure (e.g., logical or"

In other words, the label of the MCSet includes the anchor of its fully lexicalized tree. The application of this model to (1) is shown in Figure 1. Note that this account only requires the expressivity of Tree-Local MCTAGs and that unlike other approaches for gapping in the LTAG framework (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996; Seddah and Sagot, 2006; Lichte and Kallmeyer, 2010), this proposal for gapping does not require any special device or modification of the formalism itself. In order to model derivations that involve the elision of one syntactic verbal argument as in right node raising cases (RNR) or right subject elision coordinations, the formalism is extended with oriented links, called local shared derivation (local SD), between mandatory derivation site nodes: whenever a derivation is not realized on a given node and assuming that a local SD has been defined between this node and one possible antecedent, a derivation between those nodes is inserted in the"

Nevertheless, being tied to the domain of locality of a tree set, the very nature of this mechanism forbids the sharing of derivations between different tree sets, thus preventing it from analyzing non-local elliptic coordinations. In this paper, we introduce an extension of this model that can handle non-local elliptic coordination — close to unbounded ellipsis (Milward, 1994) —, which can be found in structures involving 2 See (Abeillé, 2006; Mouret, 2006) for discussions about this assumption. 101 Djamé Seddah, Benoit Sagot, Laurence Danlos α-aimer    a)               α-et ✟ N0↓ S ✟❍ ✟✟ ❍ ❍ V [aimer] b) ❍ N1↓          ✟ S↓ Sc ✟❍ ✟✟ ❍❍ N0↓ V N1↓        ε  S ✟❍ ❍ ✟ ❍ et Sc ↓ α-X N α-et ✟❍ ✟✟ ❍❍ ✟✟ α-aimer(a) ✟❍ ✟ ❍ ✟ ❍ α-Jean α-Marie ❍❍ α-aimer(b) ✟❍ ✟ ❍ ✟ ❍ α-Paul α-Virginie X={Jean|Marie|Paul|Virginie} Figure 1: Sketch of an analysis for “Jean aime Marie et Paul Virignie” The root label of α-aimer(b) is subscripted in order to av"

In order to model derivations that involve the elision of one syntactic verbal argument as in right node raising cases (RNR) or right subject elision coordinations, the formalism is extended with oriented links, called local shared derivation (local SD), between mandatory derivation site nodes: whenever a derivation is not realized on a given node and assuming that a local SD has been defined between this node and one possible antecedent, a derivation between th"

(1991) propose to consider elided elements as free logical variables resolved using Higher Order Unification as the solving operation. Inspired by this approach and assuming that non-constituent coordination can be analyzed with ellipsis (Beavers and Sag, 2004),2 we consider elliptic coordination as involving parallel structures where all non lexically realized syntactic elements must be represented in a derivation structure. This path was also followed by Seddah (2008) who proposed to use the ability of Multi Component TAGs (MCTAGs) (Weir, 1988) to model such a parallelism by including conjunct trees in a same tree set. This simple proposal allows for a straightforward analysis of gapping constructions. The coverage of this account is then extended by introducing links called local shared derivations which, by allowing derivations to be shared across trees of a same set, permit to handle various elliptic coordinate structures in an efficient way.

This skteches the proof that the set of languages generated by MCTAG-LSDs is the same as that generated by MCTAGs. Therefore, MCTAG-LSDs and MCTAGs have the same weak generative capacity. Moreover, these considerations still hold while restricting GM CT AG to be TL-MCTAG. Therefore, TL-MCTAG-LSDs and TL-MCTAGs have the same weak generative power. In order to cope with very large grammar size, the use of regular operators to factorize out TAG trees has been proposed by (Villemonte de La Clergerie, 2005), and has lead to a drastic reduction of the number of trees in the grammar. The resulting formalism is called factorized TAGs and was adapted by Seddah (2008) to the MCTAG-LSD framework in order to handle n-ary coordinations. The idea is to factorize MCTAG-LSD sets that have the same underlying MCTAG set (i.e. they are identical if links are ignored). Indeed, all such MC sets can be merged into one unique tree set associated with the union of all corresponding link sets. However, as with factorized TAGs, we need to add to the resulting tree set a list of constraints, R, on the construction of"

It is an object language of trees in the derived tree case and an object language of strings in the yield case.

It is also natural then to use the same approach for fronted discourse adverbials, as in Figure 10(b). Because the adverb has to adjoin within the tree that is being substituted, describing such an operation seems not to be possible in TAG nor in multicomponent TAG (at least in a single step). It would be possible with D-Tree Substitution Grammars (Rambow et al., 2001), but then the derivation trees would be different, the synchronous syntax-semantics interface would have to be redefined, and the reversibility properties (for generation) would have to be stated.

All the examples may be run and tested with the appropriate software. 1 Introduction It is usually assumed that the internal structure of a text, typically characterized by discourse or rhetorical relations, plays an important role in its overall interpretation. Building this structure may resort to different techniques such as segmenting the discourse into elementary discourse units and then relating them with appropriate relations (Marcu, 2000; Soricut and Marcu, 2003). Other techniques use discourse grammars, and a particular trend relies on tree grammars (Polanyi and van den Berg, 1996; Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997).

Frame typing facilitates coherence checking of the resource in a “virtuous circle”. We present the principles underlying a program we developed and used to automatically type frames in Verb@net. We also show that our system is portable to other languages. 1 Introduction VerbNet is a broad-coverage resource for English verbs in which verbs are grouped according to shared syntactic behaviors, namely surface realizations of their argument structure and syntactic alternations they are involved in (Kipper-Schuler, 2005; Kipper et al., 2006).

So far, we have only discussed cases where discourse relations between two spans of text are explicitly signalled by lexical items (primary or secondary connectives, or free connectives phrases); such relations are called “explicit relations“. However, it happens quite frequently — roughly, half of the time (Braud and Denis, 2016) — that discourse relations are not overtly marked; they are called “implicit relations“. To illustrate, the causal relation between Fred’s jokes and his friends’ hilarity is explicit in (14a-b) — first presented in Section 1 — and implicit in (14c) (14) a. Fred didn’t stop joking.

The paper defines primary and secondary connectives, and explains why it is possible to build a lexicon for the compositional ones and how it could be organized. It also puts forward the utility of such a lexicon in discourse annotation and parsing. Finally, it opens the discussion on the constructions that signal a discourse relation between two spans of text. 1 Introduction Lexicons generally record a list of lexemes — e.g., a list of English verbs in VerbNet (Karin Kipper and Palmer, 2006) —-or a list of multiword expressions (MWEs) — see (Losnegaard et al., 2016) for a survey on MWE ressources. We quote (Savary and Cordeiro, 2018): ”Multiword expressions are word combinations, such as all of a sudden, a hot dog, to pay a visit or to pull ones leg, which exhibit lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies. (. . . ) A prominent feature of many MWEs (. . . ) is their non-compositional semantics, i.e. the fact that their meaning cannot be deduced from the meanings of their components, and from their syntactic structure, in a way deemed regular for the given language.” We propose to build lexicons for compositional word combin"

This task generally relies on a lexicon of primary connectives which is projected into the corpus. A verification phase is needed to check that any item in the lexicon is actually used as a connective in the corpus: for example, in short in English is either a connective adverbial or a word sequence in the MWE in short supply; similarly bref in French is either a connective adberbial (‘in short’) or an adjective (‘short’). Next, the sense and the arguments of the connective are annotated. During the annotation of the PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008), it has been noted that discourse relations may be explicitly signalled by word combinations which are not primary connectives; they are called “alternative lexicalizations” (AltLex) (Prasad et al., 2010). In the PDTB-2 corpus, 624 tokens are annotated as AltLex. They correspond in our terminology either to primary connectives7 , or secondary connectives or free connecting phrases. According to (Prasad et al., 2010), word combinations are annotated as AltLex when there is no (primary) connective and when “a discourse relation is inferred, but insertion of a connective leads to redundancy”.
