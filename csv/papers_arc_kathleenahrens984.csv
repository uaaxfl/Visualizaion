We participate in all four phases of competition with both datasets, i.e. Verbs and AllPOS on the VUA and the TOFEL datasets. We use the modality exclusivity and embodiment norms for constructing a conceptual representation of the nodes and the context. Our system obtains an F-score of 0.652 for the VUA Verbs track, which is 5{\%} higher than the strong baselines. The experimental results across models and datasets indicate the salient contribution of using modality exclusivity and modality shift information for predicting metaphoricity."

We will concentrate on the character similarity clustering approach and concept similarity clustering approach to predict the senses of non-assigned words by using corpora and tools, such as Chinese Gigaword Corpus, and HowNet. In this study, we would then like to evaluate their predictions via the sense divisions of Chinese Wordnet and Xiandai Hanyu Cidian. Using these corpora, we will determine the clusters of our four target words ---- chi1 eat, wan2 play, huan4 change and shao1 burn in order to predict their all possible senses and evaluate them. This requirement will demonstrate the visibility of the corpus-based approaches."

We focus on seventy-seven Chinese novel verbs that appeared about ten years ago, defining their survival/failure in the real world, and examine the accurate prediction ratio of the two models. Both models display an overall accuracy of about 60 percent. However, as certain factors, e.g., unobtrusiveness, appear to be invalid predictors for the Chinese data, we attempt to improve the results by deleting inappropriate factors and by adjusting the weightings. As the overall accuracy was improved to about 70 percent, we suggest that this study would shed light on the potential factors that influence the survival of Chinese novel verbs."

The present study applies the measurement of conceptual similarity to conceptual metaphor research by comparing concreteness of ontological resource nodes to several prototypical concrete nodes selected by human subjects. Here, the purpose of comparing conceptual similarity between nodes is to select a concrete sense for a word which is used metaphorically. Through using WordNet-SUMO interface such as SinicaBow (Huang, Chang and Lee, 2004), concrete senses of a lexicon will be selected once its SUMO nodes have been compared in terms of conceptual similarity with the prototypical concrete nodes. This study has strong implications for the interaction of psycholinguistic and computational linguistic fields in conceptual metaphor research."

However, most lexical resources, such as WordNet or online dictionaries, at this point do not usually indicate figurative meanings, such as conceptual metaphors, as part of a lexical entry. Studies that attempt to establish the relationships between literal and figurative language by detecting the connectivity between WordNet relations usually do not deal with linguistic data directly. However, the present study demonstrates that SUMO definitions can be used to identify the source domains used in conceptual metaphors. This is achieved by identifying the relationships between metaphorical expressions and their corresponding ontological nodes. Such links are important because they show which lexical items are mapped under which concepts. This, in turn, helps specify which lexical items in electronic resources involve conceptual mappings. Looking specifically at the concept of PERSON, this work also establishes connectivity between lexical items which are related to xe2x80x9cOrganism.xe2x80x9d Therefore, the methodology reported herein not only aids the categorizing of lexical items according to their conceptual domains but also can establish links between these items. Such bottom-up and top-down analyses of lexical items may provide a means of representing metaphorical entries in lexical resources."

Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001) examined this question by running a comparative, corpus-based study of metaphors in Spanish and English financial reporting. They argue that both languages show considerable similarity in the choice of conceptual metaphors with the same linguistic expressions but that there is a differing degree of frequency. They attribute this similarity to the common cultural identity of the two languages such as the similar economic system and their Latinate origins. In this paper, we use a corpus-based approach in comparing the choice of conceptual metaphors in Mandarin Chinese with those of Spanish and English. We focus our discussion on the conceptual metaphor STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN WATER in Mandarin Chinese and compare it with the Spanish and English data. We carry out our analysis within the framework of the Conceptual Mapping (CM) Model (Ahrens 2002). With this model, we are able to demonstrate that although different languages share similar conceptual metaphors, they differ in what is mapped linguistically. These differences can be shown in their specific Mapping Principles."

In Ahrens, Chung and Huang (2003), they proposed to delimit the Mapping Principle via two steps: First, they used a corpora-based analysis on the word jingji xe2x80x98economyxe2x80x99 to find out the most prototypical mappings in a metaphor Second, they used an upper ontology (SUMO) to examine whether the mapping principle is a representation of conceptual knowledge in the ontology. This paper goes a step further by examining the similarities and differences of source domains in English and Chinese. Using the Conceptual Mapping Model, this paper looks particularly into the example of ECONOMY IS A PERSON. This paper observes the representation of shared knowledge in the source domain in different languages and explains the similarities and differences by looking into the definition of inference rules in the upper ontology of SUMO."
Y01-1002,A Comparative Study of {E}nglish and {C}hinese Synonym Pairs : An Approach based on The Module-Attribute Representation of Verbal Semantics,2001,2,0,1,1,15811,kathleen ahrens,"Proceedings of the 15th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation",0,"The Module-Attribute Representation of Verbal Semantics (MARVS) is a theory of the representation of verbal semantics that is developed based on Mandarin Chinese data (Huang et al., 2000). This theory proposes two types of modules: event structure modules and role modules, as well as two sets of attributes: event-internal attributes and role-internal attributes which are linked to the event structure module and role module respectively. These module-attribute semantic representations have associated grammatical consequences. Studies in MARVS (e.g. Biq 2000) found that the composition of an event modules and its attested lexical semantic attribute(s) could be generalized to a natural semantic class. For example, the contrast between bai3 ( `set') and fang4 ( `pue) in Mandarin Chinese to do with the fact that bai3 has a roleinternal feature of [design] attached to the location role, while fang4 does not. Moreover, this contrast can be generalized across the semantic class of verbs that involve design on the focussed location role (i.e. hua4 'to paint') and those that do not (i.e. tu2 'to cover with paint, to doodle'). What we would like to determine in this paper is if similar contrasts be found in near synonyms of other languages. In particular, are event modules in other languages (such as English) organized along similar conceptual lines? In this paper, we examine this theory in light of the English data. In particular, we will look at the near synonym contrast of the verbs 'put' and 'set' based on data from the two million word sampler of the British National Corpus (BNC). To preview our results, we find that the event structure in English is slightly different from that of Chinese. In Chinese, bai3 has a role-internal feature of [design] attached to the location role, while fang4 does not. However, in English, 'put' has the roles of Agent, Theme and Location in its event structure, while 'set' has the three roles of Agent, Theme, and Proposition. Thus, conceptualizations of 'set' and 'put' in English and Mandarin have different semantic and syntactic entailments."

Our method involves determining the distributional differences in syntactic patterns, deducing the semantic features from the syntactic phenomena, and testing the semantic features in new syntactic frames. We determine the distributional differences in syntactic patterns through the following five steps: First, we search for all instances of the verb in the corpus. Second, we classify each of these instances into its type of syntactic function. Third, we classify each of these instances into its argument structure type. Fourth, we determine the aspectual type that is associated with each verb. Lastly, we determine each verb's sentential type. Once the distributional differences have been determined, then the relevant semantic features are postulated. Our goal is to tease out the lexical semantic features as the explanation, and as the motivation of the syntactic contrasts."

Construction specific rules are common when transformations are envisioned as tree to tree operations in classical TG. On the other extreme, constructions, as well as all structural properties, are regarded as derived linguistic properties predictable from various principles in recent GB theories. Since whether a construction is an autonomous linguistic entity or not has great implications for either a formal or a computational linguistic theory, we will examine the status of Mandarin existential construction based on the theory of Construction Grammar [1,2]. We will show that the Mandarin existential construction represents an unique structure-meaning pair that cannot be captured in a grammar unless the pairing is regarded as a theoretical entity in linguistics ([3]). Since constructions are shown to exist in Mandarin Chinese, we support the theoretical claims of Construction Grammar as well as the position that constructions must be taken into account in NLP. I. Existential constructions and its two sub-constructions The existential sentences in Mandarin Chinese, such as (1) and (2), have been traditionally considered to involve movement or lexical rule in a verb-centered paradigm. (1)Zhuo-shang fang LE yi ben shu. table on put ASP a CL book 'There is a book on the table' (2) Chuang-shang tang ZHE yi ge ren. bed on lie ASP a CL person 'There is a person lying on the bed' The surface structure of these existential sentences can be schematized as follows: (3) [ Locative V Theme ] The apparent structural uniformity represented by (3) gives the verb-centered accounts their strongest motivation. This is because a verb-centered account can easily predict the structure by the cross-the-board nature of the movement rule or the lexical projection rule. However, there are two facts involving the existential sentences that would prove difficult for verbcentered accounts but could be easily predicted by a constructional account. First, the existential meaning is manifested only when the structure schema of (3) is employed. In other words, if the existential sense is attributed to the verbs, the grammar will be overloaded with unnecessary ambiguities in structures other than (3). The verb-centered"

Thus the paradoxes reflect what the psychologist William James referred to in 1892 as the 'spiritual me, material me, and social me' . In addition, these paradoxes mirror neurological phenomena found in brain damaged patients. In short, the linguistic and neurological findings point to a strikingly similar portrait of the Self, and argue for studying metaphorical paradoxes in greater detail in order to gain insight into other aspects of our conceptual framework."
