Despite the proven efficacy of deep neural networks at-large, their opaqueness is a major cause of concern. In this tutorial, we will present research work on interpreting fine-grained components of a neural network model from two perspectives, i) fine-grained interpretation, and ii) causation analysis. The former is a class of methods to analyze neurons with respect to a desired language concept or a task. The latter studies the role of neurons and input features in explaining the decisions made by the model. We will also discuss how interpretation methods and causation analysis can connect towards better interpretability of model prediction. Finally, we will walk you through various toolkits that facilitate fine-grained interpretation and causation analysis of neural models."

Fighting this infodemic has been declared one of the most important focus areas of the World Health Organization, with dangers ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading xenophobia and panic. Addressing the issue requires solving a number of challenging problems such as identifying messages containing claims, determining their check-worthiness and factuality, and their potential to do harm as well as the nature of that harm, to mention just a few. To address this gap, we release a large dataset of 16K manually annotated tweets for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i) focuses on COVID-19, (ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers, social media platforms, policy makers, and society, and (iii) covers Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, and English. Finally, we show strong evaluation results using pretrained Transformers, thus confirming the practical utility of the dataset in monolingual vs. multilingual, and single task vs. multitask settings."

We found small subsets of neurons to predict linguistic tasks, with lower level tasks (such as morphology) localized in fewer neurons, compared to higher level task of predicting syntax.

Our analysis reveals interesting insights, such as i) 85{\%} of the neurons across the network are redundant and ii) at least 92{\%} of them can be removed when optimizing towards a downstream task.

Geolocation information of pertinent tweets is crucial for gaining situational awareness and delivering aid. However, the majority of tweets do not come with geoinformation. In this work, we focus on the task of location mention recognition from crisis-related tweets. Specifically, we investigate the influence of different types of labeled training data on the performance of a BERT-based classification model. We explore several training settings such as combing in- and out-domain data from news articles and general-purpose and crisis-related tweets. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of geospatial proximity while training on near or far-away events from the target event. Using five different datasets, our extensive experiments provide answers to several critical research questions that are useful for the research community to foster research in this important direction. For example, results show that, for training a location mention recognition model, Twitter-based data is preferred over general-purpose data; and crisis-related data is preferred over general-purpose Twitter data. Furthermore, training on data from geographically-nearby disaster events to the target event boosts the performance compared to training on distant events."

We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word structure captured within the learned representations, which is an important aspect in translating morphologically rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models trained in an end-to-end fashion, without being provided any direct supervision during the training process, learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include the following observations: (i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers of the model; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about word-morphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models."

Given a collection of trained models, we measure the similarity of their internal representations and attention. Critically, these models come from vastly different architectures. We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks."

This is because the internal understanding that needs to be built in order to be able to translate from one language to another is much more comprehensive. Unfortunately, computational and memory limitations as of present prevent NMT models from using large word vocabularies, and thus alternatives such as subword units (BPE and morphological segmentations) and characters have been used. Here we study the impact of using different kinds of units on the quality of the resulting representations when used to model morphology, syntax, and semantics. We found that while representations derived from subwords are slightly better for modeling syntax, character-based representations are superior for modeling morphology and are also more robust to noisy input."

There are two types of diacritics, namely core-word diacritics and case-endings. Most previous works on automatic Arabic diacritic recovery rely on a large number of manually engineered features, particularly for case-endings. In this work, we present a unified character level sequence-to-sequence deep learning model that recovers both types of diacritics without the use of explicit feature engineering. Specifically, we employ a standard neural machine translation setup on overlapping windows of words (broken down into characters), and then we use voting to select the most likely diacritized form of a word. The proposed model outperforms all previous state-of-the-art systems. Our best settings achieve a word error rate (WER) of 4.49{\%} compared to the state-of-the-art of 12.25{\%} on a standard dataset."

The model is trained on noisy unlabeled data using the EM algorithm. During training the transliteration sub-model learns to generate transliteration pairs and the fixed non-transliteration model generates the noise pairs. After training, the unlabeled data is disambiguated based on the posterior probabilities of the two sub-models. We evaluate our transliteration mining system on data from a transliteration mining shared task and on parallel corpora.

In the methods to integrate transliterations, we observed improvements from 0.23-0.75 ( 0.41) BLEU points across 7 language pairs. We also show that our mined transliteration corpora provide better rule coverage and translation quality compared to the gold standard transliteration corpora."
D14-1154,Verifiably Effective {A}rabic Dialect Identification,2014,12,19,2,0,486,kareem darwish,Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing ({EMNLP}),0,"Several recent papers on Arabic dialect identification have hinted that using a word unigram model is sufficient and effective for the task. However, most previous work was done on a standard fairly homogeneous dataset of dialectal user comments. In this paper, we show that training on the standard dataset does not generalize, because a unigram model may be tuned to topics in the comments and does not capture the distinguishing features of dialects. We show that effective dialect identification requires that we account for the distinguishing lexical, morphological, and phonological phenomena of dialects. We show that accounting for such can improve dialect detection accuracy by nearly 10% absolute."

We report results of the translation tasks from German, Spanish, Czech and Russian into English and from English to German, Spanish, Czech, French and Russian. The systems described in this paper use OSM (Operation Sequence Model). We explain different pre-/post-processing steps that we carried out for different language pairs. For German-English we used constituent parsing for reordering and compound splitting as preprocessing steps. For Russian-English we transliterated the unknown words. The transliteration system is learned with the help of an unsupervised transliteration mining algorithm."

We generate improved word alignment of the training data by incorporating an unsupervised transliteration mining module to GIZA and build a phrase-based machine translation system. For tuning, we use a variation of PRO which provides better weights by optimizing BLEU1 at corpus-level. We transliterate out-of-vocabulary words in a postprocessing step by using a transliteration system built on the transliteration pairs extracted using an unsupervised transliteration mining system. For the Russian to English translation direction, we apply linguistically motivated pre-processing on the Russian side of the data."

In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG 0 , which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points."

We crawl a multilingual collection community generated subtitles, and present the results of processing the Arabic{--}English portion of the data, which yields a parallel corpus of about 2.6M Arabic and 3.9M English words. We explore different approaches to align the segments, and extrinsically evaluate the resulting parallel corpus on the standard TED-talks tst-2010. We observe that the data can be successfully used for this task, and also observe an absolute improvement of 1.6 BLEU when it is used in combination with TED data. Finally, we analyze some of the specific challenges when translating the educational content."

We used one phrase-based and two hierarchical decoders, exploring various settings thereof. We further experimented with three domain adaptation methods, and with various Arabic word segmentation schemes. Combining the output of several systems yielded a gain of up to 3.4 BLEU points over the baseline. Here we also describe a specialized normalization scheme for evaluating Arabic output, which was adopted for the IWSLT{'}2013 evaluation campaign."

Our model is efficient, language pair independent and mines transliteration pairs in a consistent fashion in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

C12-1143,Underspecified Query Refinement via Natural Language Question Generation,2012,14,3,1,1,3156,hassan sajjad,Proceedings of {COLING} 2012,0,"Underspecified queries are common in vertical search engines, leading to large result sets that are difficult for users to navigate. In this paper, we show that we can automatically guide users to their target results by engaging them in a dialog consisting of well-formed binary questions mined from unstructured data. We propose a system that extracts candidate attribute-value question terms from unstructured descriptions of records in a database. These terms are then filtered using a Maximum Entropy classifier to identify those that are suitable for question formation given a user query. We then select question terms via a novel ranking function that aims to minimize the number of question turns necessary for a user to find her target result. We evaluate the quality of system-generated questions for grammaticality and refinement effectiveness. Our final system shows best results in effectiveness, percentage of well-formed questions, and percentage of answerable questions over three baseline systems."

In contrast to previous work, our method uses no form of supervision, and does not require linguistically informed preprocessing. We conduct experiments on data sets from the NEWS 2010 shared task on transliteration mining and achieve an F-measure of up to 92%, outperforming most of the semi-supervised systems that were submitted. We also apply our method to English/Hindi and English/Arabic parallel corpora and compare the results with manually built gold standards which mark transliterated word pairs. Finally, we integrate the transliteration module into the GIZA word aligner and evaluate it on two word alignment tasks achieving improvements in both precision and recall measured against gold standard word alignments."

We build joint source channel models on the automatically aligned orthographic transliteration units of the automatically extracted lists of transliteration pairs resulting in two transliteration systems. We compare our systems with three transliteration systems available on the web, and show that our systems have better performance. We perform an extensive analysis of the results of using both methods and show evidence that the unsupervised transliteration mining method is superior for applications requiring high recall transliteration lists, while the rule-based method is useful for obtaining high precision lists."

We propose two probabilistic models, based on conditional and joint probability formulations, that are novel solutions to the problem. Our models consider both transliteration and translation when translating a particular Hindi word given the context whereas in previous work transliteration is only used for translating OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. We use transliteration as a tool for disambiguation of Hindi homonyms which can be both translated or transliterated or transliterated differently based on different contexts. We obtain final BLEU scores of 19.35 (conditional probability model) and 19.00 (joint probability model) as compared to 14.30 for a baseline phrase-based system and 16.25 for a system which transliterates OOV words in the baseline system. This indicates that transliteration is useful for more than only translating OOV words for language pairs like Hindi-Urdu."

After providing a separate lexicon of 70,568 types, SVM tool again shows the best accuracy of 95.66%."
