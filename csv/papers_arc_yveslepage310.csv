This provides the potential to use HamNoSys, i.e., strings of characters, as a representation of an SL corpus instead of video material. Processing strings of characters instead of images can significantly contribute to sign language research. However, the complexity of HamNoSys makes it difficult to annotate without a lot of time and effort. Therefore annotation has to be automatized. This work proposes a conceptually new approach to this problem. It includes a new tree representation of the HamNoSys grammar that serves as a basis for the generation of grammatical training data and classification of complex movements using machine learning. Our automatic annotation system relies on HamNoSys grammar structure and can potentially be used on already existing SL corpora. It is retrainable for specific settings such as camera angles, speed, and gestures. Our approach is conceptually different from other SL recognition solutions and offers a developed methodology for future research."

Multilingual neural machine translation (NMT), on the other hand, allows a model to perform translation between several language pairs, even between language pairs for which no sentences pair has been seen during training (zero-shot translation). This paper presents experiments with zero-shot translation on low resource Indian languages with a very small amount of data for each language pair. We first report results on balanced data over all considered language pairs. We then expand our experiments for additional three rounds by increasing the training data with 2,000 sentence pairs in each round for some of the language pairs. We obtain an increase in translation accuracy with its balanced data settings score multiplied by 7 for Manipuri to Hindi during Round-III of zero-shot translation."

Experimental results show that simple additional processing improves the performance of word alignment, which is measured by counting alignment matches in comparison with fast align.

Since the existence of translation divergences, it is impractical to straightforward translate from source sentence into target sentence while keeping the high degree of accuracy and without additional information. In this paper, we investigate the problem from an emerging and special point of view: bigrams and the corresponding translations. We first profile corpora and explore the constituents of bigrams in the source language. Then we translate unseen bigrams based on proportional analogy and filter the outputs using an Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiment results also show that even a small set of features from analogous can provide meaningful information in translating by analogy."

These similarities measure the degree between words or word pairs. Attributional similarities are bidrectional, while relational similarities are one-directional. It is possible to compute such similarities based on the occurrences of words in actual sentences. Inside sentences, syntagmatic associations and paradigmatic associations can be used to characterize the relations between words or word pairs. In this paper, we propose a vector space model built from syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations to measure relational similarity between word pairs from the sentences contained in a small corpus.

A machine transliteration model is built to transliterate out-ofvocabulary Japanese katakana words into English words. A Japanese dependency structure analyzer is employed to tackle outof-vocabulary kanji and hiragana words. The evaluation results demonstrate that it is an effective approach for addressing out-ofvocabulary word problems and decreasing the OOVs rate in the Japanese-to-English machine translation tasks."

To handle longer and more varied sentences, cutting the sentences into chunks could be a solution if the number of analogies between chunks is confirmed to be large. This paper thus reports counts of number of analogies using different numbers of chunk markers in 11 European languages. These experiments confirm that the number of analogies between chunks is very large: several tens of thousands of analogies between chunks extracted from sentences among which only very few analogies, if not none, were found."

The method can handle several languages at once. The phrase tables obtained by the method have a comparable accuracy and a higher coverage than those obtained by current methods. They are also obtained much faster.

We participated in all four language pair translation tasks (CE, JE, AE and IE) and all two tracks (OPEN and CSTAR). We used a phrase-based SMT in the OPEN track and a hybrid multiple translation engine in the CSTAR track. We also equipped our system with some of new preprocessing and post-processing techniques for Chinese word segmentation, named entity translation, punctuation and capitalization, sentence splitting, and language model adaptation. Our experiments show these features significantly improved our system."

We measured the quality of the paraphrases produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their grammaticality: at least 99% correct sentences; (ii) their equivalence in meaning: at least 96% correct paraphrases either by meaning equivalence or entailment; and, (iii) the amount of internal lexical and syntactical variation in a set of paraphrases: slightly superior to that of hand-produced sets. The paraphrase sets produced by this method thus seem adequate as reference sets to be used for MT evaluation."

It uses a specific operation, namely proportional analogy, that implicitly neutralises divergences between languages and captures lexical and syntactical variations along the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes without explicitly decomposing sentences into fragments. In an experiment with a test set of 510 input sentences and an unprocessed corpus of almost 160,000 aligned sentences in Japanese and English, we obtained BLEU, NIST and mWER scores of 0.53, 8.53 and 0.39 respectively, well above a baseline simulating a translation memory."

But computational linguists seem to be quite dubious about analogies between sentences: they would not be enough numerous to be of any use. We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains. We give two estimates, a lower one and a higher one. As an analogy must be valid on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning, we relied on the idea that translation should preserve meaning to test for similar meanings."

For example, given the series walk, walked and look, how can we coin the fourth term, looked? We give a possible account of this phenomenon in terms of edition distances, thus paving the way to computational applications. This explanation accounts for prefixing, suffixing and infixing. We show how it is possible to perform the analogical analysis and generation of sentences, using a tree-bank and approximate pattern-matching.
