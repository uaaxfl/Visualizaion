Millions of Internet users face harassment, racism, personal attacks, and other types of abuse across various platforms. The psychological effects of abuse on individuals can be profound and lasting. Consequently, over the past few years, there has been a substantial research effort towards automated abusive language detection in the field of NLP. In this position paper, we discuss the role that modeling of users and online communities plays in abuse detection. Specifically, we review and analyze the state of the art methods that leverage user or community information to enhance the understanding and detection of abusive language. We then explore the ethical challenges of incorporating user and community information, laying out considerations to guide future research. Finally, we address the topic of explainability in abusive language detection, proposing properties that an explainable method should aim to exhibit. We describe how user and community information can facilitate the realization of these properties and discuss the effective operationalization of explainability in view of the properties."

Our experiments expose how attitudes towards different social groups vary across models and how quickly emotions and stereotypes can shift at the fine-tuning stage."

Aiming to further close this gap, we propose a model of semantic memory for WSD in a meta-learning setting. Semantic memory encapsulates prior experiences seen throughout the lifetime of the model, which aids better generalization in limited data settings. Our model is based on hierarchical variational inference and incorporates an adaptive memory update rule via a hypernetwork. We show our model advances the state of the art in few-shot WSD, supports effective learning in extremely data scarce (e.g. one-shot) scenarios and produces meaning prototypes that capture similar senses of distinct words."

We evaluate a range of semantic models (word embeddings, compositional, and visual models) in their ability to decode brain activity associated with reading of both literal and metaphoric sentences. Our results suggest that compositional models and word embeddings are able to capture differences in the processing of literal and metaphoric sentences, providing support for the idea that the literal meaning is not fully accessible during familiar metaphor comprehension."

Meta-learning aims to solve this problem by training a model on a large number of few-shot tasks, with an objective to learn new tasks quickly from a small number of examples. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for few-shot word sense disambiguation (WSD), where the goal is to learn to disambiguate unseen words from only a few labeled instances. Meta-learning approaches have so far been typically tested in an N-way, K-shot classification setting where each task has N classes with K examples per class. Owing to its nature, WSD deviates from this controlled setup and requires the models to handle a large number of highly unbalanced classes. We extend several popular meta-learning approaches to this scenario, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in this new challenging setting."

Our results show reduced decoding (correlation) of sentences where the verb is in the negated context, as compared to the affirmative one, within brain regions implicated in action-semantic processing. This supports behavioral and brain imaging studies, suggesting that negation involves reduced access to aspects of the affirmative mental representation. The results pave the way for testing alternate semantic models of negation against human semantic processing in the brain."

However, deliberate obfuscation of words by users to evade detection poses a serious challenge to the effectiveness of these efforts. The current state of the art approaches to abusive language detection, based on recurrent neural networks, do not explicitly address this problem and resort to a generic OOV (out of vocabulary) embedding for unseen words. However, in using a single embedding for all unseen words we lose the ability to distinguish between obfuscated and non-obfuscated or rare words. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a model that can compose embeddings for unseen words. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach significantly advances the current state of the art in abuse detection on datasets from two different domains, namely Twitter and Wikipedia talk page."

However, cognitive evidence suggests that humans are likely to perform these two tasks simultaneously, as part of a holistic metaphor comprehension process. We present a novel method that performs metaphor identification through its interpretation, being the first one in NLP to combine the two tasks in one step. It outperforms the previous approaches to metaphor identification both in terms of accuracy and coverage, as well as providing an interpretation for each identified expression."
N13-1118,Unsupervised Metaphor Identification Using Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering,2013,41,19,1,1,4353,ekaterina shutova,Proceedings of the 2013 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,0,"We present a novel approach to automatic metaphor identification, that discovers both metaphorical associations and metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text. Our system first performs hierarchical graph factorization clustering (HGFC) of nouns and then searches the resulting graph for metaphorical connections between concepts. It then makes use of the salient features of the metaphorically connected clusters to identify the actual metaphorical expressions. In contrast to previous work, our method is fully unsupervised. Despite this fact, it operates with an encouraging precision (0.69) and recall (0.61). Our approach is also the first one in NLP to exploit the cognitive findings on the differences in organisation of abstract and concrete concepts in the human brain."
J13-2003,Statistical Metaphor Processing,2013,117,72,1,1,4353,ekaterina shutova,Computational Linguistics,0,"Metaphor is highly frequent in language, which makes its computational processing indispensable for real-world NLP applications addressing semantic tasks. Previous approaches to metaphor modeling rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge and operate on a limited domain or a subset of phenomena. We present the first integrated open-domain statistical model of metaphor processing in unrestricted text. Our method first identifies metaphorical expressions in running text and then paraphrases them with their literal paraphrases. Such a text-to-text model of metaphor interpretation is compatible with other NLP applications that can benefit from metaphor resolution. Our approach is minimally supervised, relies on the state-of-the-art parsing and lexical acquisition technologies distributional clustering and selectional preference induction, and operates with a high accuracy."
C12-2109,Unsupervised Metaphor Paraphrasing using a Vector Space Model,2012,28,27,1,1,4353,ekaterina shutova,Proceedings of {COLING} 2012: Posters,0,"We present the first fully unsupervised approach to metaphor interpretation, and a system that produces literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions. Such a form of interpretation is directly transferable to other NLP applications that can benefit from a metaphor processing component. Our method is different from previous work in that it does not rely on any manually annotated data or lexical resources. First, our method computes candidate paraphrases according to the context in which the metaphor appears, using a vector space model. It then uses a selectional preference model to measure the degree of literalness of the paraphrases. The system identifies correct paraphrases with a precision of 0.52 at top rank, which is a promising result for a fully unsupervised approach."

Both of them have been repeatedly addressed in NLP. This paper is the first comprehensive and systematic review of the existing computational models of metaphor, the issues of metaphor annotation in corpora and the available resources."

Such a representation is directly transferable to other applications that can benefit from a metaphor processing component. Our method is distinguished from the previous work in that it does not rely on any hand-crafted knowledge about metaphor, but in contrast employs automatically induced selectional preferences. Being the first of its kind, our system is capable of paraphrasing metaphorical expressions with a high accuracy (0.81)."
shutova-teufel-2010-metaphor,Metaphor Corpus Annotated for Source - Target Domain Mappings,2010,21,55,1,1,4353,ekaterina shutova,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'10),0,"Besides making our thoughts more vivid and filling our communication with richer imagery, metaphor also plays an important structural role in our cognition. Although there is a consensus in the linguistics and NLP research communities that the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of isolated words, but rather involves reconceptualization of a whole area of experience (target domain) in terms of another (source domain), there still has been no proposal for a comprehensive procedure for annotation of cross-domain mappings. However, a corpus annotated for conceptual mappings could provide a new starting point for both linguistic and cognitive experiments. The annotation scheme we present in this paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test our procedure in an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their agreement on the task. The associated corpus annotated for source â target domain mappings will be publicly available."

Starting from a small seed set of manually annotated metaphorical expressions, the system is capable of harvesting a large number of metaphors of similar syntactic structure from a corpus. Our method is distinguished from previous work in that it does not employ any hand-crafted knowledge, other than the initial seed set, but, in contrast, captures metaphoricity by means of verb and noun clustering. Being the first to employ unsupervised methods for metaphor identification, our system operates with the precision of 0.79."
P09-3001,Sense-based Interpretation of Logical Metonymy Using a Statistical Method,2009,17,7,1,1,4353,ekaterina shutova,Proceedings of the {ACL}-{IJCNLP} 2009 Student Research Workshop,0,"The use of figurative language is ubiquitous in natural language texts and it is a serious bottleneck in automatic text understanding. We address the problem of interpretation of logical metonymy, using a statistical method. Our approach originates from that of Lapata and Lascarides (2003), which generates a list of non-disambiguated interpretations with their likelihood derived from a corpus. We propose a novel sense-based representation of the interpretation of logical metonymy and a more thorough evaluation method than that of Lapata and Lascarides (2003). By carrying out a human experiment we prove that such a representation is intuitive to human subjects. We derive a ranking scheme for verb senses using an unannotated corpus, WordNet sense numbering and glosses. We also provide an account of the requirements that different aspectual verbs impose onto the interpretation of logical metonymy. We tested our system on verb-object metonymic phrases. It identifies and ranks metonymic interpretations with the mean average precision of 0.83 as compared to the gold standard."
