In our scheme, mentions of entities are annotated with ontology-based types, and the roles of the entities are annotated as relations with other entities described in the text. So far, we have annotated 400 abstracts from the ACL anthology and the ACM digital library. In this paper, the scheme and the annotated dataset are described, along with the problems found in the course of annotation. We also show the results of automatic annotation and evaluate the corpus in a practical setting in application to topic extraction."

Although a number of resources and methods addressing aspects of the task have been introduced, there have so far been no annotated corpora for training and evaluating systems for broad-coverage, open-domain anatomical entity mention detection. We introduce the AnEM corpus, a domain- and species-independent resource manually annotated for anatomical entity mentions using a fine-grained classification system. The corpus texts are selected randomly from citation abstracts and full-text papers with the aim of making the corpus representative of the entire available biomedical scientific literature. We demonstrate the use of the corpus through an evaluation of the broad-coverage MetaMap tagger and a CRF-based system trained on the corpus data, considering also a combination of these two methods. The combined system demonstrates a promising level of performance, approaching 80% F-score for mention detection for a relaxed matching criterion.

We introduce several entity normalization algorithms for genes, proteins, protein complexes and protein components, aiming to uniquely identify these biological entities. This normalization effort allows direct mapping of the extracted events and relations with post-translational modifications from UniProt, epigenetics from PubMeth, functional domains from InterPro and macromolecular structures from PDB.

In providing for the first time the outputs of a broad set of state-of-the-art event extraction systems, this resource opens many new opportunities for studying aspects of event extraction, from the identification of common errors to the study of effective approaches to combining the strengths of systems. We demonstrate these opportunities through a multi-system analysis on three BioNLP ST 2011 main tasks, focusing on events that none of the systems can successfully extract. We further argue for new perspectives to the performance evaluation of domain event extraction systems, considering a document-level, off-the-page representation and evaluation to complement the mention-level evaluations pursued in most recent work."

Typical pathways involve large numbers of entities of various types whose associations are represented as reactions involving arbitrary numbers of reactants, outputs and modifiers. Until recently, few information extraction approaches were capable of resolving the level of detail in text required to support the annotation of such pathway representations. We argue that event representations of the type popularized by the BioNLP Shared Task are potentially applicable for pathway annotation support. As a step toward realizing this possibility, we study the mapping from a formal pathway representation to the event representation in order to identify remaining challenges in event extraction for pathway annotation support. Following initial analysis, we present a detailed study of protein association and dissociation reactions, proposing a new event class and representation for the latter and, as a step toward its automatic extraction, introduce a manually annotated resource incorporating the type among a total of nearly 1300 annotated event instances. As a further practical contribution, we introduce the first pathway-to-event conversion software for SBML/CellDesigner pathways and discuss the opportunities arising from the ability to convert the substantial existing pathway resources to events."

While both aim to address protein/gene annotation, their annotation principles differ notably. One key difference is that GENETAG annotates the conceptual entity, gene, which is often associated with a function, while GENIA concentrates on the physical forms of gene, i.e. protein, DNA and RNA. The difference has caused serious problems relating to the compatibility and comparability of the annotations. In this work, we present an extension of GENIA annotation which integrates GENETAG-style gene annotation.

In addition, patterns are divided into components to improve recall and we introduce a Support Vector Machine to learn a prediction model using pattern matching results.
