Although coordination has been explored extensively in the linguistics literature, the rules and constraints that govern its structure are still largely elusive and widely debated amongst linguists. This paper presents a study of two-termed unlike coordinations in particular, where the two conjuncts of the coordination phrase form valid constituents but have distinct categories. We conducted a syntactic analysis of the phrasal categories that can be conjoined in such unlike coordinations through a computational corpus-based approach, utilizing the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) as the main data source, as well as the Penn Treebank (PTB). The results show that the two conjuncts within unlike coordinations display different properties based on their position, supporting an antisymmetric view of the structure of coordination. This research provides new data and perspectives through the use of statistical techniques that can help shape future theories and models of coordination."

Few of these studies, however, have given attention to the critical intersection of race and gender. In this case study, we analyze the dimensions of gender and race in contextualized word embeddings of given names, taken from BERT, and investigate the nature and nuance of their interaction. We find that these demographic axes, though typically treated as physically and conceptually separate, are in fact interdependent and thus inadvisable to consider in isolation. Further, we show that demographic dimensions predicated on default settings in language, such as in pronouns, may risk rendering groups with multiple marginalized identities invisible. We conclude by discussing the importance and implications of intersectionality for future studies on bias and debiasing in NLP."

We then associate each such n-gram with the corresponding product aspect and its related star rating. Next, based on the star scores, we generate adjective scales reflecting the relative strength of specific adjectives associated with a shared attribute of the product. An automatic ordering of the adjectives {``}correct{''} (correct), {``}sympa{''} (nice), {``}bon{''} (good) and {``}excellent{''} (excellent) according to their score in our resource is consistent with an intuitive scale based on human judgments.

The ambiguity hampers the vocabulary effectiveness when used by people with language disabilities. For example, the noun a missing letter may refer to a character or a written message, and each corresponds to a different picture. A vocabulary with images and sounds unambiguously linked to words can better eliminate misunderstanding and assist communication for people with language disorders. We explore a new approach of creating such a vocabulary via automatically assigning semantically unambiguous groups of synonyms to sound and image labels. We propose an un-supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) voting algorithm, which combines different semantic relatedness measures. Our voting algorithm achieved over 80% accuracy with a sound label dataset, which significantly outperforms WSD with individual measures. We also explore the use of human judgments of evocation between members of concept pairs, in the label disambiguation task. Results show that evocation achieves similar performance to most of the existing relatedness measures."

Whereas English compounds are head-final and thus left-branching, Czech and Zulu compounds usually consist of a leftmost governing head and a rightmost dependent element. Semantic properties of compounds are discussed with special reference to semantic relations between compound members which cross-linguistically show universal patterns, but idiosyncratic, language specific compounds are also identified. The integration of compounds into lexical resources, and WordNets in particular, remains a challenge that needs to be considered in terms of the compoundsÂ syntactic idiosyncrasy and semantic compositionality. Experiments with processing compounds in Czech, English and Zulu are reported and partly evaluated. The obtained partial lists of the Czech, English and Zulu compounds are also described."

In our current work, we are seeking to augment WordNet as a knowledge resource for language understanding in several ways: adding in formal versions of its word sense definitions (glosses); classifying the morphosemantic links between nouns and verbs; encoding a small number of core theories about WordNet's most commonly used terms; and adding in simple representations of scripts.

To derive maximal benefit from the semantic information provided by these resources, the MASC will also include manually-validated shallow parses and named entities, which will enable linking WordNet senses and FrameNet frames within the same sentences into more complex semantic structures and, because named entities will often be the role fillers of FrameNet frames, enrich the semantic and pragmatic information derivable from the sub-corpus.
