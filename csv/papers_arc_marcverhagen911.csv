It can enable exploration and discovery over large datasets of complex networks by exploiting the semantics of the relations in them. This involves extracting information, applying parameter reduction operations, building hierarchical data representation and designing visualization. We also present the accompanying COVID-SemViz a searchable and interactive visualization system for knowledge exploration of COVID-19 data to demonstrate the application of our proposed method. In the user studies, users found that semantic visualization-powered COVID-SemViz is helpful in terms of finding relevant information and discovering unknown associations."

An In-Depth, Side-by-Side Comparison of Three Designs",2017,10,2,7,0,11279,richard castilho,Proceedings of the 11th Linguistic Annotation Workshop,0,"For decades, most self-respecting linguistic engineering initiatives have designed and implemented custom representations for various layers of, for example, morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis. Despite occasional efforts at harmonization or even standardization, our field today is blessed with a multitude of ways of encoding and exchanging linguistic annotations of these types, both at the levels of {`}abstract syntax{'}, naming choices, and of course file formats. To a large degree, it is possible to work within and across design plurality by conversion, and often there may be good reasons for divergent design reflecting differences in use. However, it is likely that some abstract commonalities across choices of representation are obscured by more superficial differences, and conversely there is no obvious procedure to tease apart what actually constitute contentful vs. mere technical divergences. In this study, we seek to conceptually align three representations for common types of morpho-syntactic analysis, pinpoint what in our view constitute contentful differences, and reflect on the underlying principles and specific requirements that led to individual choices. We expect that a more in-depth understanding of these choices across designs may led to increased harmonization, or at least to more informed design of future representations."

As in aspect-based sentiment analysis, we focus on identifying not only the components of products but also the attributes and tasks which, in the case of patents, serve to justify an inventionxe2x80x99s utility. These semantic roles (component, task, attribute) can serve as a high level ontology for categorizing domain terminology, within which the positive/negative polarity of attributes serves to identify technical goals and obstacles. We show that bootstrapping using a very small set of domain-independent lexico-syntactic features may be sufficient for constructing domainspecific classifiers capable of assigning semantic roles and polarity to terms in domains as diverse as computer science and health."

The goal of ATLIS is to be able to take in a document as raw text and mark it up with ISO-Space annotation data, so that another program could use the information in a standardized format to reason about the semantics of the spatial information in the document. The tool (as well as ISO-Space itself) is still in the early stages of development. At present it implements a subset of the proposed ISO-Space annotation standard: it identifies expressions that refer to specific places, as well as identifying prepositional constructions that indicate a spatial relationship between two objects. In this paper, the structure of the ATLIS tool is presented, along with preliminary evaluations of its performance."

A corpus administrator can create annotation layers that involve annotation of extents, attributes or relations. The layer definition includes the labels used, the attributes that are available and restrictions on the values for those attributes. For each annotation layer, files can be assigned to one or more annotators and one judge. When annotators log in, the assigned layers and files therein are presented. When selecting a file to annotate, the interface uses the layer definition to display the annotation interface. The web-interface connects administrators and annotators to a central repository for all data and simplifies many of the housekeeping tasks while keeping requirements at a minimum (that is, users only need an internet connection and a well-behaved browser). BAT has been used mainly for temporal annotation, but can be considered a more general tool for several kinds of textual annotation."
