These features are however mainly developed for English. In this paper, we investigate their relevance for Czech, German, English, Spanish, and Italian text simplification corpora. Our multi-lingual and multi-domain corpus analysis shows that the relevance of different features for text simplification is different per corpora, language, and domain. For example, the relevance of the lexical complexity is different across all languages, the BLEU score across all domains, and 14 features within the web domain corpora. Overall, the negative statistical tests regarding the other features across and within domains and languages lead to the assumption that text simplification models may be transferable between different domains or different languages."

This collected metadata can be used to get insights regarding the difficulty of an annotation with the same type or frame or can be used as an input of an annotation cost measurement for an active learning algorithm. The tool was already used to build a manually annotated corpus with semantic frames and its arguments for task 2 of SemEval 2019 regarding unsupervised lexical frame induction (QasemiZadeh et al., 2019). Although English sentences from the Wall Street Journal corpus of the Penn Treebank were annotated for this task, it is also possible to use the proposed tool for the annotation of sentences in other languages."

Beyond the prediction task, we use the classifier results as a source for a manual annotation step in order to identify new, unseen instances of each alternation. This is possible because existing alternation datasets contain positive, but no negative instances and are not comprehensive. Over several sequences of classification-annotation steps, we iteratively extend our sets of alternating verbs. Our hybrid approach to the identification of new alternating verbs reduces the required annotation effort by only presenting annotators with the highest-scoring candidates from the previous classification. Due to the success of semi-supervised and unsupervised features, our approach can easily be transferred to further alternations."

To this end, we use probabilistic linear context-free rewriting systems for data-driven parsing, following recent work on parsing German. In order to do so, we first perform a transformation of the Penn Treebank annotation of non-local dependencies into an annotation using crossing branches. The resulting treebank can be used for PLCFRS-based parsing. Our evaluation shows that, compared to PCFG parsing with the same techniques, PLCFRS parsing yields slightly better results. In particular when evaluating only the parsing results concerning long-distance dependencies, the PLCFRS approach with discontinuous constituents is able to recognize about 88% of the dependencies of type *T* and *T*-PRN encoded in the Penn Treebank. Even the evaluation results concerning local dependencies, which can in principle be captured by a PCFG-based model, are better with our PLCFRS model. This demonstrates that by discarding information on non-local dependencies the PCFG model loses important information on syntactic dependencies in general."

The scope possibilities of a quantifier are determined by its surface position, its base position and the type of the quantifier. In this paper we propose a multicomponent analysis for German quantifiers computing the scope of the quantifier, in particular its minimal nuclear scope, depending on the syntactic configuration it occurs in."
W06-1511,Licensing {G}erman Negative Polarity Items in {LTAG},2006,14,2,2,1,16508,timm lichte,Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms,0,Our paper aims at capturing the distribution of negative polarity items (NPIs) within lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG). The condition under which an NPI can occur in a sentence is for it to be in the scope of a negation with no quantifiers scopally intervening. We model this restriction within a recent framework for LTAG semantics based on semantic unification. The proposed analysis provides features that signal the presence of a negation in the semantics and that specify its scope. We extend our analysis to modelling the interaction of NPI licensing and neg raising constructions.

There are striking similarities between the frameworks that make them comparable in many respects. We will exemplify the differences and similarities by looking at several phenomena. We will show, first of all, that many intuitions about the mechanisms of semantic computations can be implemented in similar ways in both frameworks. Secondly, we will identify some aspects in which the frameworks intrinsically differ due to more general differences between the approaches to formal grammar adopted by LTAG and HPSG."
J05-2003,Tree-Local Multicomponent {T}ree-{A}djoining {G}rammars with Shared Nodes,2005,36,24,1,1,5576,laura kallmeyer,Computational Linguistics,0,"This article addresses the problem that the expressive power of tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs) is too limited to deal with certain syntactic phenomena, in particular, with scrambling in free-word-order languages. The TAG variants proposed so far in order to account for scrambling are not entirely satisfying. Therefore, the article introduces an alternative extension of TAG that is based on the notion of node sharing, so-called (restricted) tree-local multicomponent TAG with shared nodes (RSN-MCTAG). The analysis of some German scrambling data is sketched in order to show that this TAG extension can deal with scrambling. Then it is shown that for RSN-MCTAGs of a specific type, equivalent simple range concatenation grammars can be constructed. As a consequence, these RSN-MCTAGs are mildly context-sensitive and in particular polynomially parsable. These specific RSN-MCTAGs probably can deal not with all scrambling phenomena, but with an arbitrarily large subset."

Articles courts,0,"Multicomponent Tree Adjoining Grammars (MCTAG) is a formalism that has been shown to be useful for many natural language applications. The definition of MCTAG however is problematic since it refers to the process of the derivation itself: a simultaneity constraint must be respected concerning the way the members of the elementary tree sets are added. Looking only at the result of a derivation (i.e., the derived tree and the derivation tree), this simultaneity is no longer visible and therefore cannot be checked. I.e., this way of characterizing MCTAG does not allow to abstract away from the concrete order of derivation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an alternative definition of MCTAG that characterizes the trees in the tree language of an MCTAG via the properties of the derivation trees the MCTAG licences."

We consider questions involving pied piping and stranding and we propose elementary trees and semantic representations that allow to account for both constructions in a uniform way.

Within this framework, several sample analyses are proposed, and it is shown that the framework allows to analyze data that have been claimed to be problematic for derivation tree based LTAG semantics approaches."

It is shown that the present approach derives the correct semantics for examples claimed to be problematic for LTAG semantic approaches based on the derivation tree. The paper further provides an LTAG semantics for embedded interrogatives.
