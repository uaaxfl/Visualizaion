To do so, we build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks."

Transformer-based models generally demonstrate superior performance on the majority of languages, achieving {\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy on 65{\%} of them. The languages on which systems yielded low accuracy are mainly under-resourced, with a limited amount of data. Most errors made by the systems are due to allomorphy, honorificity, and form variation. In addition, we observe that systems especially struggle to inflect multiword lemmas. The systems also produce misspelled forms or end up in repetitive loops (e.g., RNN-based models). Finally, we report a large drop in systems' performance on previously unseen lemmas."

Although this representation captures the phonology of the language, it is not a one-to-one mapping with the Arabic script version. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that Arabizi on social media is Dialectal Arabic which does not have a standard orthography. Furthermore, Arabizi tends to include a lot of code mixing between Arabic and English (or French). To map Arabizi text to Arabic script in the context of complete utterances, previously published efforts have split Arabizi detection and Arabic script target in two separate tasks. In this paper, we present the first effort on a unified model for Arabizi detection and transliteration into a code-mixed output with consistent Arabic spelling conventions, using a sequence-to-sequence deep learning model.

This method gives error reduction of 9.9{\%} on CATiB and 6.1{\%} on UD compared to a strong baseline, and ablation tests show that the main contribution of this reduction is given by sharing tree representation between tasks, and not simply sharing BiLSTM layers as is often performed in NLP multitask systems."

The morphological features can be lexicalized, like lemmas and diacritized forms, or non-lexicalized, like gender, number, and part-of-speech tags, among others. Joint modeling of the lexicalized and non-lexicalized features can identify more intricate morphological patterns, which provide better context modeling, and further disambiguate ambiguous lexical choices. However, the different modeling granularity can make joint modeling more difficult. Our approach models the different features jointly, whether lexicalized (on the character-level), or non-lexicalized (on the word-level).

We use multitask learning for joint morphological modeling for the features within two dialects, and as a knowledge-transfer scheme for cross-dialectal modeling. We use adversarial training to learn dialect invariant features that can help the knowledge-transfer scheme from the high to low-resource variants.

Given a small number of out-of-context rules describing closed class morphology, we combine them with word embeddings leveraging subword strings and noise reduction techniques.

Our best L1 readability accuracy result is 94.8{\%} (75{\%} error reduction from a commonly used baseline). The comparable results for L2 are 72.4{\%} (45{\%} error reduction). We also demonstrate the added value of leveraging L1 features for L2 readability prediction."

The quality of embeddings relies on large non-noisy corpora. Arabic dialects lack large corpora and are noisy, being linguistically disparate with no standardized spelling. We make three contributions to address this noise. First, we describe simple but effective adaptations to word embedding tools to maximize the informative content leveraged in each training sentence. Second, we analyze methods for representing disparate dialects in one embedding space, either by mapping individual dialects into a shared space or learning a joint model of all dialects. Finally, we evaluate via dictionary induction, showing that two metrics not typically reported in the task enable us to analyze our contributions{'} effects on low and high frequency words. In addition to boosting performance between 2-53{\%}, we specifically improve on noisy, low frequency forms without compromising accuracy on high frequency forms."

The challenging nature of noisy text processing is exacerbated for dialectal content, where in addition to spelling and lexical differences, dialectal text is characterized with morpho-syntactic and phonetic variations. These issues increase sparsity in NLP models and reduce accuracy. We present a neural morphological tagging and disambiguation model for Egyptian Arabic, with various extensions to handle noisy and inconsistent content. Our models achieve about 5{\%} relative error reduction (1.1{\%} absolute improvement) for full morphological analysis, and around 22{\%} relative error reduction (1.8{\%} absolute improvement) for part-of-speech tagging, over a state-of-the-art baseline."

We propose the CoNLL universal lattices (CoNLL-UL) format, a new annotation format for word lattices that represent morphological analyses, and provide resources that obey this format for a range of typologically different languages.

Recently, neural-network-based approaches have outperformed well-established models in this task. However, in languages other than English, there has been little exploration in this direction. Both the scarcity of annotated data and the complexity of the language increase the difficulty of the problem. To address these challenges, we use a sequence-to-sequence model with character-based attention, which in addition to its self-learned character embeddings, uses word embeddings pre-trained with an approach that also models subword information. This provides the neural model with access to more linguistic information especially suitable for text normalization, without large parallel corpora. We show that providing the model with word-level features bridges the gap for the neural network approach to achieve a state-of-the-art F1 score on a standard Arabic language correction shared task dataset."

The created corpus of L2 text manual corrections is the largest to date. We evaluate our guidelines using inter-annotator agreement and show a high degree of consistency."

The language used in social media expresses many differences from other written genres: its vocabulary is informal with intentional deviations from standard orthography such as repeated letters for emphasis; typos and nonstandard abbreviations are common; and nonlinguistic content is written out, such as laughter, sound representations, and emoticons. This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media for two reasons. First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic phonologically, morphologically and lexically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies. Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, SMS messaging and online chat often use a non-standard romanization called Arabizi. In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing state-of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing expect Arabic script input. The corpus described in this paper is expected to support Arabic NLP by providing this resource."

By the very nature of Egyptian Arabic, the data collected is informal, for example Discussion Forum text, which we use for the treebank discussed here. In addition, Egyptian Arabic, like other Arabic dialects, is sufficiently different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that tools and techniques developed for MSA cannot be simply transferred over to work on Egyptian Arabic work. In particular, a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic is needed to mediate between the written text and the segmented, vocalized form used for the syntactic trees. This led to the necessity of a feedback loop between the treebank team and the analyzer team, as improvements in each area were fed to the other. Therefore, by necessity, there needed to be close cooperation between the annotation team and the tool development team, which was to their mutual benefit. Collaboration on this type of challenge, where tools and resources are limited, proved to be remarkably synergistic and opens the way to further fruitful work on Arabic dialects."

We find that more informative fine-grained tag sets are useful in the gold condition, but may be detrimental in the predicted condition, where they are outperformed by simpler but more accurately predicted tag sets. We identify a set of features definiteness, person, number, gender, and undiacritized lemma that improve parsing quality in the predicted condition, whereas other features are more useful in gold. We are the first to show that functional features for gender and number e.g., broken plurals, and optionally the related rationality humanness feature, are more helpful for parsing than form-based gender and number. We finally show that parsing quality in the predicted condition can dramatically improve by training in a combined goldpredicted condition. We experimented with two transition-based parsers, MaltParser and Easy-First Parser. Our findings are robust across parsers, models, and input conditions. This suggests that the contribution of the linguistic knowledge in the tag sets and features we identified goes beyond particular experimental settings, and may be informative for other parsers and morphologically rich languages."

In cases of diglossia, as in Arabic, one variant, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), has many resources that can be used to build natural language processing tools. Whereas other variants, Arabic dialects, are resource poor. Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of limited resources, consists in performing a translation of the dialect into MSA in order to use the tools developed for MSA. We describe in this paper an architecture for such a translation and we evaluate it on Tunisian Arabic verbs. Our approach relies on modeling the translation process over the deep morphological representations of roots and patterns, commonly used to model Semitic morphology. We compare different techniques for how to perform the cross-lingual mapping. Our evaluation demonstrates that the use of a decent coverage rootpattern lexicon of Tunisian and MSA with a backoff that assumes independence of mapping roots and patterns is optimal in reducing overall ambiguity and increasing recall."

In this paper, we present a series of experiments on the automatic prediction of the latent linguistic features of functional gender and number, and rationality in Arabic. We compare two techniques, using simple maximum likelihood (MLE) with back-off and a support vector machine based sequence tagger (Yamcha). We study a number of orthographic, morphological and syntactic learning features. Our results show that the MLE technique is preferred for words seen in the training data, while the Yam-cha technique is optimal for unseen words, which are our real target. Furthermore, we show that for unseen words, morphological features help beyond orthographic features and that syntactic features help even more. A combination of the two techniques improves overall performance even further."

Features can be modeled as part of the core translation process mapping source tokens to target tokens. Alternatively these features can be generated using target monolingual context as part of a separate generation (or post-translation inflection) step. Finally, the features can be predicted using both source and target information in a separate step from translation and generation. We focus on three morphological features that we demonstrate through a manual error analysis to be most problematic for English-Arabic SMT: gender, number and the determiner clitic. Our results show significant improvements over a state-ofthe-art baseline (phrase-based SMT) of almost 1% absolute BLEU on a medium size training set. Our best configuration models the determiner as part of core translation and predicts gender and number separately, and handles the rest of the features through generation."

In this paper, we investigate the influence of four different approaches for integrating MT and CLIR on both retrieval accuracy and user judgment of relevancy. We create a corpus with relevance judgments for both human and machine translated results, and use it to quantify the effect that MT quality has on end-to-end relevance. We find that MT errors result in a 16-39{\%} decrease in mean average precision over the ground truth system that uses human translations. MT errors also caused relevant sentences to appear irrelevant {--} 5-19{\%} of sentences were relevant in human translation, but were judged irrelevant in MT. To counter this degradation, we present two hybrid retrieval models and two automatic MT post-editing techniques and show that these approaches substantially mitigate the errors and improve the end-to-end relevance."

In this paper, we present two parse fuzzification techniques which allow the translation system to select among a range of possible S--V re-orderings.

We present here a novel method for improving distributional paraphrasing by filtering out such candidates. We evaluate it in simulated low and mid-resourced SMT tasks, translating from English to two quite different languages. We show statistically significant gains in English-to-Chinese translation quality, up to 1 Bleu from non-filtered paraphrase-augmented models (1.6 Bleu from baseline).

We therefore propose to reorder VS constructions into SV order for SMT word alignment only.

This paper describes a new approach to morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic, a genre difficult to compare with other forms of Arabic. Processing Quranic Arabic is a unique challenge from a computational point of view, since the vocabulary and spelling differ from Modern Standard Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus differs from other Arabic computational resources in adopting a tagset that closely follows traditional Arabic grammar. We made this decision in order to leverage a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, and to encourage online collaborative annotation. In this paper, we discuss how the unique challenge of morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic is solved using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic morphological tagging using diacritic edit-distance, two-pass manual verification, and online collaborative annotation. This process is evaluated to validate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology."

A detailed evaluation of the current implementation comparing it to a commonly used morphological analyzer shows that it has good morphological coverage with precision and recall scores in the 90s.

In addition, while detecting verbs and their subjects is a hard task, our syntactic parser detects VS constructions better in matrix than in non-matrix clauses. As a result, reordering only matrix VS for word alignment consistently improves translation quality over a phrase-based SMT baseline, and over reordering all VS constructions, in both medium- and large-scale settings. In fact, the improvements obtained by reordering matrix VS on the medium-scale setting remarkably represent 44{\%} of the gain in BLEU and 51{\%} of the gain in TER obtained with a word alignment training bitext that is 5 times larger."

The phonotactic approach we use proves to be effective in identifying these dialects with considerable overall accuracy --- 81.60% using 30s test utterances."

The parsers were trained on MSA resources and adapted using dialect-MSA lexical resources (some developed especially for this task) and existing linguistic knowledge about syntactic differences between MSA and dialect. The use of the LATB for development and evaluation of syntactic parsers allowed the PAD team to provide feedbasck to the LDC treebank developers.

Their task was to match open-class lexical items (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to one or more concepts taken from the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2003), and to identify theta roles for verb arguments. The annotated corpus is intended to be a resource for meaning-based approaches to machine translation. Here we discuss inter-annotator agreement for the corpus. The annotation task is characterized by annotatorsÂ freedom to select multiple concepts or roles per lexical item. As a result, the annotation categories are sets, the number of which is bounded only by the number of distinct annotator-lexical item pairs. We use a reliability metric designed to handle partial agreement between sets. The best results pertain to the part of the ontology derived from WordNet. We examine change over the course of the project, differences among annotators, and differences across parts of speech. Our results suggest a strong learning effect early in the project."

The approach depends on the existence of rich target language resources such as word lexical semantics, including in- formation about categorical variations and subcategorization frames. These resources are used to generate multiple structural variations from a target-glossed lexico-syntactic representation of the source language sentence. The multiple structural variations account for different translation divergences. The overgeneration of the approach is constrained by a target-language model using corpus-based statistics. The exploitation of target language resources (symbolic and statistical) to handle a problem usually reserved to Transfer and Interlingual MT is useful for translation from structurally divergent source languages with scarce linguistic resources. A preliminary evaluation on the application of this approach to Spanish-English MT proves this approach extremely promising. The approach however is not limited to MT as it can be extended to monolingual NLG applications such as summarization."

habash-dorr-2002-handling,Handling translation divergences: combining statistical and symbolic techniques in generation-heavy machine translation,2002,19,34,1,1,517,nizar habash,Proceedings of the 5th Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas: Technical Papers,0,"This paper describes a novel approach to handling translation divergences in a Generation-Heavy Hybrid Machine Translation (GHMT) system. The translation divergence problem is usually reserved for Transfer and Interlingual MT because it requires a large combination of complex lexical and structural mappings. A major requirement of these approaches is the accessibility of large amounts of explicit symmetric knowledge for both source and target languages. This limitation renders Transfer and Interlingual approaches ineffective in the face of structurally-divergent language pairs with asymmetric resources. GHMT addresses the more common form of this problem, source-poor/targetrich, by fully exploiting symbolic and statistical target-language resources. This non-interlingual non-transfer approach is accomplished by using target-language lexical semantics, categorial variations and subcategorization frames to overgenerate multiple lexico-structural variations from a target-glossed syntactic dependency of the source-language sentence. The symbolic overgeneration, which accounts for different possible translation divergences, is constrained by a statistical target-language model."
2001.mtsummit-papers.26,Large scale language independent generation using thematic hierarchies,2001,1,3,1,1,517,nizar habash,Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit VIII,0,Abstract : This paper describes a large-scale language-independent evaluation of the use of Thematic Hierardies in natural language generation. We translate from a corpus of sentences reflecting the full variety of behavior of Levin-based verb classes. The corpus is used as input to a generation system that utilizes the same thematic hierarchy for realizing relative argument surface positions in two languages; English and Spanish. The output was manually evaluated by English and Spanish speakers. The contributions of this work include: (1) an improved thematic hierarchy over an earlier implementation; (2) a large-scale evaluation of the use of thematic hierarchies in two languages; (3) an implementation of a language independent module for natural language generation; and (4) the creation of a single tool for incremental development of multilingual lexicons.

This system has been developed as part of a Chinese-English Machine Translation system, however, it promises to be useful for many other MT language pairs. The generation system has also been used in Cross-Language information retrieval research (Levow et al., 2000)."
habash-2000-oxygen,Oxygen: a language independent linearization engine,2000,5,8,1,1,517,nizar habash,Proceedings of the Fourth Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas: Technical Papers,0,"This paper describes a language independent linearization engine, oxyGen. This system compiles target language grammars into programs that take feature graphs as inputs and generate word lattices that can be passed along to the statistical extraction module of the generation system Nitrogen. The grammars are written using a flexible and powerful language, oxyL, that has the power of a programming language but focuses on natural language realization. This engine has been used successfully in creating an English linearization program that is currently employed as part of a Chinese-English machine translation system."

We provide a mapping between LCS thematic roles and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) relations; these relations serve as input to an off-the-shelf generator (Nitrogen). There are two contributions of this work: (1) the development of a thematic hierarchy that provides ordering information for realization of arguments in their surface positions; (2) the provision of a diagnostic tool for detecting inconsistencies in an existing online LCS-based lexicon that allows us to enhance principles for thematic-role assignment.
