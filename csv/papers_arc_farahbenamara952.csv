We propose: (1) the first dataset annotated for gender stereotype detection, (2) a new method for data augmentation based on sentence similarity with multilingual external datasets, and (3) a set of deep learning experiments first to detect gender stereotypes and then, to use this auxiliary task for sexism detection. Although the presence of stereotypes does not necessarily entail hateful content, our results show that sexism classification can definitively benefit from gender stereotype detection."

We present TWIFIL (TWItter proFILing) a collaborative annotation platform for crowdsourcing annotation of tweets at different levels of granularity. The plateform allowed the creation of the largest Algerian dialect dataset annotated for both sentiment (9,000 tweets), emotion (about 5,000 tweets) and extra-linguistic information including author profiling (age and gender). The annotation resulted also in the creation of the largest Algerien dialect subjectivity lexicon of about 9,000 entries which can constitute a valuable resources for the development of future NLP applications for Algerian dialect. To test the validity of the dataset, a set of deep learning experiments were conducted to classify a given tweet as positive, negative or neutral. We discuss our results and provide an error analysis to better identify classification errors."

This paper presents the first French corpus annotated for sexism detection composed of about 12,000 tweets. In a context of offensive content mediation on social media now regulated by European laws, we think that it is important to be able to detect automatically not only sexist content but also to identify if a message with a sexist content is really sexist (i.e. addressed to a woman or describing a woman or women in general) or is a story of sexism experienced by a woman. This point is the novelty of our annotation scheme. We also propose some preliminary results for sexism detection obtained with a deep learning approach. Our experiments show encouraging results."

It focuses on the contribution from syntactic knowledge, exploiting linguistic resources where syntax is annotated according to the Universal Dependencies scheme. Three distinct experimental settings are provided. In the first, a variety of syntactic dependency-based features combined with classical machine learning classifiers are explored. In the second scenario, two well-known types of word embeddings are trained on parsed data and tested against gold standard datasets. In the third setting, dependency-based syntactic features are combined into the Multilingual BERT architecture. The results suggest that fine-grained dependency-based syntactic information is informative for the detection of irony."

J18-4006,Introduction to the Special Issue on Language in Social Media: Exploiting Discourse and Other Contextual Information,2018,51,4,1,1,7013,farah benamara,Computational Linguistics,0,"Social media content is changing the way people interact with each other and share information, personal messages, and opinions about situations, objects, and past experiences. Most social media texts are short online conversational posts or comments that do not contain enough information for natural language processing (NLP) tools, as they are often accompanied by non-linguistic contextual information, including meta-data (e.g., the user{'}s profile, the social network of the user, and their interactions with other users). Exploiting such different types of context and their interactions makes the automatic processing of social media texts a challenging research task. Indeed, simply applying traditional text mining tools is clearly sub-optimal, as, typically, these tools take into account neither the interactive dimension nor the particular nature of this data, which shares properties with both spoken and written language. This special issue contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of these interactions to process social media data from a new perspective in discourse interpretation. This introduction first provides the necessary background to understand what context is from both the linguistic and computational linguistic perspectives, then presents the most recent context-based approaches to NLP for social media. We conclude with an overview of the papers accepted in this special issue, highlighting what we believe are the future directions in processing social media texts."
J17-1006,Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words: Linguistic Insights and Computational Applications,2017,392,13,1,1,7013,farah benamara,Computational Linguistics,0,"The study of evaluation, affect, and subjectivity is a multidisciplinary enterprise, including sociology, psychology, economics, linguistics, and computer science. A number of excellent computational linguistics and linguistic surveys of the field exist. Most surveys, however, do not bring the two disciplines together to show how methods from linguistics can benefit computational sentiment analysis systems. In this survey, we show how incorporating linguistic insights, discourse information, and other contextual phenomena, in combination with the statistical exploitation of data, can result in an improvement over approaches that take advantage of only one of these perspectives. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to evaluative language from both a linguistic and computational perspective. We then argue that the standard computational definition of the concept of evaluative language neglects the dynamic nature of evaluation, in which the interpretation of a given evaluation depends on linguistic and extra-linguistic contextual factors. We thus propose a dynamic definition that incorporates update functions. The update functions allow for different contextual aspects to be incorporated into the calculation of sentiment for evaluative words or expressions, and can be applied at all levels of discourse. We explore each level and highlight which linguistic aspects contribute to accurate extraction of sentiment. We end the review by outlining what we believe the future directions of sentiment analysis are, and the role that discourse and contextual information need to play."

Informed by linguistic theories, we propose for the first time a multi-layered annotation schema for irony and its application to a corpus of French, English and Italian tweets. We detail each layer, explore their interactions, and discuss our results according to a qualitative and quantitative perspective."
S15-1016,Mapping Different Rhetorical Relation Annotations: A Proposal,2015,22,8,1,1,7013,farah benamara,Proceedings of the Fourth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics,0,"Annotation efforts have resulted in the availability of a number of corpora with rhetorical relation information. The corpora, unfortunately, are annotated under different theoretical approaches and have different hierarchies of relations. In addition, new sets of rhetorical relations have been proposed to account for language variation. The types of relations, however, tend to overlap or be related in specific ways. We believe that differences across approaches are minimal, and a unified set of relations that works across languages is possible. This paper details a new taxonomy of relations organized in four top level-classes with a total of 26 relations. We propose a mapping between existing annotations and show that our taxonomy is robust across theories, and can be applied to multiple languages."

Based on linguistic experiments informed by native speakers, we distil these effects according to the type of modality and negation. The model relies on a parabolic representation where an opinion expression is represented as a point on a parabola. Negation is modelled as functions over this parabola whereas modality through a family of parabolas of different slopes; each slope corresponds to a different certainty degree. The model is evaluated using two experiments, one involving direct strength judgements on a 7-point scale and the other relying on a sentiment annotated corpus. The empirical evaluation of our model shows that it matches the way humans handle negation and modality in opinionated sentences"

Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each playerxe2x80x99s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.

Based on linguistic experiments informed by native speakers, we distill these effects according to the type of modality and negation. We show that each type has a specific effect on the opinion expression in its scope: both on the polarity and the strength for negation, and on the strength and/or the degree of certainty for modality. The empirical results reported in this paper provide a basis for future opinion analysis systems that have to compute the sentiment orientation at the sentence or at the clause level. The methodology we used for deriving this basis was applied for French but it can be easily instantiated for other languages like English."

Since agents do not come with their preferences transparently given in advance, we have only two means to determine what they are if we wish to exploit them in reasoning: we can infer them from what an agent says or from his nonlinguistic actions. In this paper, we analyze how to infer preferences from dialogue moves in actual conversations that involve bargaining or negotiation. To this end, we propose a new annotation scheme to study how preferences are linguistically expressed in two different corpus genres. This paper describes the annotation methodology and details the inter-annotator agreement study on each corpus genre. Our results show that preferences can be easily annotated by humans."

The corpus combines two perspectives on discourse: a bottom-up approach and a top-down approach. The bottom-up view incrementally builds a structure from elementary discourse units, while the top-down view focuses on the selective annotation of multi-level discourse structures. The corpus is composed of texts that are diversified with respect to genre, length and type of discursive organisation. The methodology followed here involves an iterative design of annotation guidelines in order to reach satisfactory inter-annotator agreement levels. This allows us to raise a few issues relevant for the comparison of such complex objects as discourse structures. The corpus also serves as a source of empirical evidence for discourse theories. We present here two first analyses taking advantage of this new annotated corpus --one that tested hypotheses on constraints governing discourse structure, and another that studied the variations in composition and signalling of multi-level discourse structures."
