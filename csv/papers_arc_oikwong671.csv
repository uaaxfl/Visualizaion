This paper discusses some observations from the Chinese Open Wordnet, especially from the adjective subnet, to illuminate potential blind spots of the approach which may lead to the formation of non-synsets in the new wordnet. With cross-linguistic differences duly taken into account, alternative representations of cross-lingual lexical relations are proposed to better capture the language-specific properties. It is also suggested that such cross-lingual representation encompassing the cognitive as well as linguistic aspects of meaning is beneficial for a lexical resource to be used by both humans and computers."

Complex interactions have been observed between learning algorithms and knowledge sources, but the factors underlying such phenomena are underexplored.

The current study thus preliminarily explores the relation between sense concreteness and the linguistic means for sense distinction with reference to the context availability model proposed in psycholinguistics and common practice in corpus-based lexicography. It will be shown that to a certain extent the varied usefulness of individual knowledge sources for target words, nouns in particular, may be related to the concreteness of the meanings concerned, which predicts how the sense is distinguished from other senses of the word in the first place. A better understanding of this relation is expected to inform the design of disambiguation systems which could then combine algorithms and knowledge sources in a genuine lexically sensitive way."

Future work thus includes exploring the possibility of deploying a wider range of surface clues from definitions for the purpose and investigating how the method works with definitions from different dictionaries."

Given its semantic nature and the need for extensive common sense and world knowledge, story understanding has been a notoriously difficult topic in natural language processing. In particular, the notion of story structure for maintaining coherence has received much attention, while its strong version in the form of story grammar has triggered much debate. The relation between discourse coherence and the interestingness, or the point, of a story has not been satisfactorily settled. Introspective analysis on story comprehension has led to some important observations, based on which we propose a preliminary annotation scheme covering the structural, functional, and emotional aspects connecting discourse segments in stories. The annotation process will shed light on how story structure interacts with story point via various linguistic devices, and the annotated corpus is expected to be a useful resource for computational discourse processing, especially for studying various issues regarding the interface between coherence and interestingness of stories."

The experiment shows that the combination of measures outperforms the individual measures, and that filtering out low-quality sentence pairs is readily justified as it can improve SMT performance. Finally, we arrive at the final corpus consisting of 160K sentence pairs in which about 90% are correct or partially correct alignments."

In this work, we study how the difficulty of automatic word sense disambiguation (WSD) might be affected by this intrinsic property of words, namely the concreteness of a word and its individual senses. We also explore the feasibility of inducing a numerical index for sense and lexical concreteness from dictionary definitions. Analysis of system performance in previous SENSEVAL exercises suggests that concrete words are often easier to disambiguate. The high overall agreement between human ratings and definition-induced ratings is also encouraging. The concreteness factor is worth the attention of computational linguists, particularly in terms of how it bears on the differential information demand of individual words in WSD and how the knowledge of this property could be employed to fine-tune WSD systems to better deal with the lexical sensitivity of the task."

Automatic classification was based on the similarity between a target word and individual categories of words in the thesaurus, measured by the cosine function. Experiments were done on 120 target words from four regions. The automatic classification results were evaluated against a gold standard obtained from human judgements.

In particular, it is important to see if the classification could accommodate new words from heterogeneous data sources, and whether simple similarity measures and clustering methods could cope with such variation. We use the cosine function for similarity and test it on automatically classifying 120 target words from four regions, using different datasets for the extraction of feature vectors. The automatic classification results were evaluated against human judgement, and the performance was encouraging, with accuracy reaching over 85% in some cases. Thus while human judgement is not straightforward and it is difficult to create a PanChinese lexicon manually, it is observed that combining simple clustering methods with the appropriate data sources appears to be a promising approach toward its automatic construction."

Four existing systems were tested for their capability in translating personal names from Chinese to English. Test data embodying geographic and sociolinguistic differences were obtained from a synchronous Chinese corpus of news media texts. It is obvious that systems vary considerably in their ability to identify personal names in the source language and render them properly in the target language. Given the criticality of personal name translation to the overall intelligibility of a translated text, the coverage of personal names should be one of the important criteria in the evaluation of MT performance. Moreover, name translation, which calls for a hybrid approach, would remain a central issue to the future development of MT systems, especially for online and real-time applications."
