This creates two challenges for finite-state model of its morpho-syntax and morphophonology: how to manage the full reduplication and the autosegmental nature of lexical tone. Dolatian and Heinz (2020) explain how 2-way finite-state transducers can model full reduplication without an exponential increase in states, and finite-state transducers with multiple tapes have been used to model autosegmental tiers, including tone (Wiebe, 1992; Dolatian and Rawski, 2020a). Here we synthesize 2-way finite-state transducers and multitape transducers, resulting in a finite-state formalism that subsumes both, to account for the full reduplicative processes in Shupamem which also affect tone."

However, some work has shown that incorporating the social network information in addition to information from language is effective for various NLP applications including sentiment analysis, inferring user attributes, and predicting inter-personal relations. In this paper, we present an empirical study of email classification into {``}Business{''} and {``}Personal{''} categories. We represent the email communication using various graph structures. As features, we use both the textual information from the email content and social network information from the communication graphs. We also model the thread structure for emails. We focus on detecting personal emails, and we evaluate our methods on two corpora, only one of which we train on. The experimental results reveal that incorporating social network information improves over the performance of an approach based on textual information only. The results also show that considering the thread structure of emails improves the performance further. Furthermore, our approach improves over a state-of-the-art baseline which uses node embeddings based on both lexical and social network information."

Our model combines the strengths of earlier models that performed SRL on the basis of a full dependency parse with more recent models that use no syntactic information at all. Our local and non-ensemble model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL 09 English and Spanish datasets. SRL models benefit from syntactic information, and we show that supertagging is a simple, powerful, and robust way to incorporate syntax into a neural SRL system."

Specifically, we investigate whether the level of commitment expressed by individuals in an organizational interaction reflects the hierarchical power structures they are part of. We find that subordinates use significantly more instances of non-commitment than superiors. More importantly, we also find that subordinates attribute propositions to other agents more often than superiors do {---} an aspect that has not been studied before. Finally, we show that enriching lexical features with commitment labels captures important distinctions in social meanings."

For example, the first twenty publications on Google Scholar returned for the Query xe2x80x9csentiment analysisxe2x80x9d all date from 2003 or later, and have a total citation count of 12,140. The total number of publications is in the thousands. Partly, this interest is driven by the immediate commercial applications of sentiment analysis. Sentiment is a xe2x80x9cprivate statexe2x80x9d (Wiebe, 1990). However, it is not the only private state that has received attention in the computational literature; others include belief and intention. In this tutorial, we propose to provide a deeper understanding of what a private state is. We will concentrate on sentiment and belief. We will provide background that will allow the tutorial participants to understand the notion of a private state as a cognitive phenomenon, which can be manifested linguistically in communication in various ways. We will explain the formalization in terms of a triple of state, source, and target. We will discuss how to model the source and the target. We will then explain in some detail the annotations that have been made. The issue of annotation is crucial for private states: while the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2007) has been around for some time, most research using it does not make use of many of its features. We believe this is because the MPQA annotation is quite complex and requires a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of xe2x80x9cprivate statexe2x80x9d, which is what the annotation is getting at. Furthermore, there are currently several efforts underway of creating new versions of annotations, which we will also present. The larger goal of this tutorial is to allow the tutorial participants to gain a deeper understanding of the role of private states in human communication, and to encourage them to use this deeper understanding in their computational work. The immediate goal of this tutorial is to allow the participants to make more complete use of available annotated resources. We propose to achieve these goals by concentrating on annotated corpora, since this will allow participants to both understand the underlying content (achieving the larger goal) and the technical details of the annotations (achieving the immediate goal)."

The language used in social media expresses many differences from other written genres: its vocabulary is informal with intentional deviations from standard orthography such as repeated letters for emphasis; typos and nonstandard abbreviations are common; and nonlinguistic content is written out, such as laughter, sound representations, and emoticons. This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media for two reasons. First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic phonologically, morphologically and lexically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies. Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, SMS messaging and online chat often use a non-standard romanization called Arabizi. In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing state-of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing expect Arabic script input.

In the first mode, English input automatically generates a picture which can be used to elicit a description in the target language. In the second mode, the linguist formally documents the grammar of an endangered language, thereby creating a system that takes input in the endangered language and generates a picture according to the grammar; the picture can then be used to verify the grammar with native speakers.

Using controlled experiments, we contrast the contribution of different part-of-speech POS tag sets and morphological features in two input conditions: machine-predicted condition in which POS tags and morphological feature values are automatically assigned, and gold condition in which their true values are known. We find that more informative fine-grained tag sets are useful in the gold condition, but may be detrimental in the predicted condition, where they are outperformed by simpler but more accurately predicted tag sets. We identify a set of features definiteness, person, number, gender, and undiacritized lemma that improve parsing quality in the predicted condition, whereas other features are more useful in gold. We are the first to show that functional features for gender and number e.g., broken plurals, and optionally the related rationality humanness feature, are more helpful for parsing than form-based gender and number. We finally show that parsing quality in the predicted condition can dramatically improve by training in a combined goldpredicted condition. We experimented with two transition-based parsers, MaltParser and Easy-First Parser. Our findings are robust across parsers, models, and input conditions. This suggests that the contribution of the linguistic knowledge in the tag sets and features we identified goes beyond particular experimental settings, and may be informative for other parsers and morphologically rich languages."

Modality is the attitude that a speaker might have toward an event or state. One of the main hurdles for training a linguistic tagger is gathering training data. This is particularly problematic for training a tagger for modality because modality triggers are sparse for the overwhelming majority of sentences. We investigate an approach to automatically training a modality tagger where we first gathered sentences based on a high-recall simple rule-based modality tagger and then provided these sentences to Mechanical Turk annotators for further annotation. We used the resulting set of training data to train a precise modality tagger using a multi-class SVM that delivers good performance.

We build novel types of networks in which links between characters are different types of social events. We show that analyzing networks based on these social events gives us insight into the roles of characters in the story. Also, static network analysis has limitations which be- come apparent from our analysis. We propose the use of dynamic network analysis to over- come these limitations. tify these limitations, few have done so with a strict and specific rubric for categorizing interactions. In this paper, we annotate Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland using a well-defined annotation scheme which we have previously developed on newswire text Agarwal et al. (2010). It is well suited to deal with the aforementioned limitations. We show that using different types of networks can be useful by al- lowing us to provide a model for determining point- of-view. We also show that social networks allow characters to be categorized into roles based on how they function in the text, but that this approach is limited when using static social networks. We then build and visualize dynamic networks and show that static networks can distort the importance of char- acters. By using dynamic networks, we can build a fuller picture of how each character works in a liter- ary text. Our paper uses an annotation scheme that is well- defined and has been used in previous computational models that extract social events from news articles (Agarwal and Rambow, 2010). This computational model may be adapted to extract these events from literary texts. However, the focus of this paper is not to adapt the previously proposed computational model to a new domain or genre, but to first demon- strate the usefulness of this annotation scheme for the analysis of literary texts, and the social networks derived from it. All results reported in this paper are based on hand annotation of the text.

We distinguish two broad types of social events depending on whether only one or both parties are aware of the social contact. We annotate part of Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, and perform experiments using Support Vector Machines with Kernel methods. We use a combination of structures derived from phrase structure trees and dependency trees. A characteristic of our events (which distinguishes them from ACE events) is that the participating entities can be spread far across the parse trees. We use syntactic and semantic insights to devise a new structure derived from dependency trees and show that this plays a role in achieving the best performing system for both social event detection and classification tasks. We also use three data sampling approaches to solve the problem of data skewness. Sampling methods improve the F1-measure for the task of relation detection by over 20% absolute over the baseline."

We classify predicates into one of three possibilities: committed belief, non committed belief, or not applicable. We proceed to manually annotate data to that end, then we build a supervised framework to test the feasibility of automatically predicting these belief states. Even though the data is relatively small, we show that automatic prediction of a belief class is a feasible task. Using syntactic features, we are able to obtain significant improvements over a simple baseline of 23% F-measure absolute points.

This pilot, consisting of morphological and syntactic annotation of approximately 26,000 words of Levantine Arabic conversational telephone speech, was developed under severe time constraints; hence the LDC team drew on their experience in treebanking Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) text. The resulting Levantine dialect treebanked corpus was used by the PAD team to develop and evaluate parsers for Levantine dialect texts. The parsers were trained on MSA resources and adapted using dialect-MSA lexical resources (some developed especially for this task) and existing linguistic knowledge about syntactic differences between MSA and dialect. The use of the LATB for development and evaluation of syntactic parsers allowed the PAD team to provide feedbasck to the LDC treebank developers.

The annotated corpus is intended to be a resource for meaning-based approaches to machine translation. Here we discuss inter-annotator agreement for the corpus. The annotation task is characterized by annotatorsÂ freedom to select multiple concepts or roles per lexical item. As a result, the annotation categories are sets, the number of which is bounded only by the number of distinct annotator-lexical item pairs. We use a reliability metric designed to handle partial agreement between sets. The best results pertain to the part of the ontology derived from WordNet. We examine change over the course of the project, differences among annotators, and differences across parts of speech. Our results suggest a strong learning effect early in the project."

A serious problem is that n-gram modeling usually considers a very small, fixed context and does not perform well with large tag sets, such as those generated by automatic grammar extraction (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000). As an alternative, Chen, Bangalore and Vijay-Shanker (1999) introduce class-based supertagging. An example of class tagging is n-best trigram-based supertagging, which assigns to each word the top n most likely supertags as determined by an n-gram supertagging model. Class-based supertagging can be performed much more accurately than supertagging with only a small increase in ambiguity. In a second phase, the most likely candidate from the class is chosen. In this paper, we investigate an approach to such a choice based on reranking a set of candidate supertags and their confidence scores. RankBoost (Freund et al., 1998) is the boosting algorithm that we use in order to learn to rerank outputs. It also has been used with good effect in reranking outputs of a statistical parser (Collins, 2000) and ranking sentence plans (Walker, Rambow and Rogati, 2001). RankBoost may learn to correct biases that are inherent in n-gram modeling which lead to systematic errors in supertagging (cf. (van Halteren, 1996)). RankBoost can also use a variety of local and long distance features more easily than n-gram-based approaches (cf. (Chen, Bangalore and Vijay-Shanker, 1999)) because it makes sparse data less of an issue. The outline of this paper is as follows. First, we develop the background and motivations behind the task of reranking the output of an n-best trigram supertagger. Second, we introduce RankBoost as the approach that we adopt in order to train the reranker. Third, we perform an initial set of experiments where the reranker is trained with different feature subsets. Fourth, we perform an in-depth analysis of several reranking models. Fifth, after pointing out causes that at times render the reranker ineffective, we develop and test some new models that attempt to sidestep these limitations. Lastly, after some significance testing results, we state our conclusions and remark on potential future directions."

Derivations in DSG involve the composition of d-trees, special kinds of tree descriptions. Trees are read off from derived d-trees.

However, the improved speech recognition has brought to light a new problem: as dialog systems understand more of what the user tells them, they need to be more sophisticated at responding to the user. The issue of system response to users has been extensively studied by the natural language generation community, though rarely in the context of dialog systems. We show how research in generation can be adapted to dialog systems, and how the high cost of hand-crafting knowledge-based generation systems can be overcome by employing machine learning techniques."

In developing stochastic methods, it is crucial to be able to quickly assess the relative merits of different approaches or models. In this paper, we present several types of intrinsic (system internal) metrics which we have used for baseline quantitative assessment. This quantitative assessment should then be augmented to a fuller evaluation that examines qualitative aspects. To this end, we describe an experiment that tests correlation between the quantitative metrics and human qualitative judgment. The experiment confirms that intrinsic metrics cannot replace human evaluation, but some correlate significantly with human judgments of quality and understandability and can be used for evaluation during development."

W98-1409,A New Approach to Expert System Explanations,1998,12,22,3,0,847,regina barzilay,Natural Language Generation,0,"Abstract : Expert systems were one of the first applications to emerge from initial research in artificial intelligence, and the explanation of expert system reasoning was one of the first applications of natural language generation. This is because the need for explanations is obvious, and generation from a knowledge-based application such as reasoning should be relatively straightforward. However, while explanation has been universally acknowledged as a desirable functionality in expert systems, natural language generation has not taken a central place in contemporary expert system development. For example, a popular text book about expert systems such as (Giarratano and Riley, 1994) stresses twice in the introduction the importance of explanation, but provides no further mention of explanation in the remaining 600 pages. (The book is based on the popular CLIPS framework.) In this paper, we present a new approach to enhancing an expert system with an explanation facility. The approach comprises both software components and a methodology for assembling the components. The methodology is minimally intrusive into existing expert system development practice. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss previous work and identify shortcomings. We present our analysis of knowledge types in Section 3. Section 4 presents the Security Assistant and its explanation facility. Finally, we sketch a general methodology for explainable expert system engineering in Section 5."

A97-1037,Customizable Descriptions of Object-Oriented Models,1997,10,23,2,1,51615,benoit lavoie,Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing,0,"With the emergence of object-oriented technology and user-centered software engineering paradigms, the requirements analysis phase has changed in two important ways: it has become an iterative activity, and it has become more closely linked to the design phase of software engineering (Davis, 1993). A requirements analyst builds a formal object-oriented (OO) domain model. A user (domain expert) validates the domain model. The domain model undergoes subsequent evolution (modi cation or adjustment) by a (perhaps di erent) analyst. Finally, the domain model is passed to the designer (system analyst), who re nes the model into a OO design model used as the basis for implementation. Thus, we can see that the OO models form the basis of many important ows of information in OO software engineering methodologies. How can this information best be communicated? It is widely believed that graphical representations are easy to learn and use, both for modeling and for communication among the engineers and domain experts who together develop the OO domain model. This belief is re ected by the large number of graphical OO modeling tools currently in research labs and on the market. However, this belief is not accurate, as some recent empirical studies show. For example, Kim (1990) simulated a modeling task with experienced analysts and a validation task with sophisticated users not familiar with the particular graphical language. Both user groups showed semantic error rates between 25% and 70% for the separately scored areas of entities, attributes, and relations. Relations were particularly troublesome to both analysts and users. Petre (1995) compares diagrams with textual representations of nested conditional structures (which can be compared to OO modeling in the complexity of the paths through the system). She nds that the intrinsic di culty of the graphics mode was the strongest e ect observed (p.35). We therefore conclude that graphics, in order to assure maximum communicative e ciency, needs to be complemented by an alternate view of the data. We claim that the alternate view should be provided by an explanation tool that represents the data in the form of a uent English text. This paper presents such a tool, the ModelExplainer, or ModEx for short, and focuses on the customizability of the system. Automatically generating natural-language descriptions of software models and speci cations is not a new idea. The rst such system was Swartout's GIST Paraphraser (Swartout, 1982). More recent projects include the paraphraser in ARIES (Johnson et al., 1992); the GEMA dataow diagram describer (Scott and de Souza, 1989); and Gulla's paraphraser for the PPP system (Gulla, 1993). ModEx certainly belongs in the tradition of these speci cation paraphrasers, but the combination of features that we will describe in the next section (and in particular the customizability) is, to our knowledge, unique."
1997.mtsummit-workshop.12,Enriching lexical transfer with cross-linguistic semantic features or how to do interlingua without interlingua,1997,7,12,2,1,5812,alexis nasr,AMTA/SIG-IL First Workshop on Interlinguas,0,"In this paper, we propose an alternative to interlingua which can capture the analyses and generalizations that interlinguas can express, but which uses cross-linguistic semantic features rather than a separate level of representation. This alternative we call lexico-structural transfer. Lexico-structural transfer relies on the expressive power of a lexicalized syntactic representation (or xe2x80x9clexicalized grammarxe2x80x9d for short). In a lexicalized grammar, lexemes are associated with syntactic structure; in the transfer lexicon, we do not simply relate words (or context-free rewrite rules) from one language to words (or context-free rewrite rules) from another language. Instead, we relate lexemes along with relevant syntactic structure (essentially, their syntactic projection along with syntactic and lexical-semantic features). Several different lexicalized grammar formalisms have been proposed in the past, including notably Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1987), Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) and various dependency grammars. We will present our work using a transfer formalism based on a dependency grammar, namely Melxe2x80x99cukxe2x80x99s Meaning Text Theory (MTT) (Melxe2x80x99cuk, 1988), specifically the xe2x80x9cDeep Syntactic Levelxe2x80x9d. This level of representation is similar in crucial respects to the derivation structures of TAG (Rambow and Joshi, 1996) and to the f-structure of LFG. There are two main reasons why we may want to investigate an alternative to the use of an interlingua:"

DTG involve two composition operations called subsertion and sister-adjunction. The most distinctive feature of DTG is that, unlike TAG, there is complete uniformity in the way that the two DTG operations relate lexical items: subsertion always corresponds to complementation and sister-adjunction to modification. Furthermore, DTG, unlike TAG, can provide a uniform analysis for wh-movement in English and Kashmiri, despite the fact that the wh element in Kashmiri appears in sentence-second position, and not sentence-initial position as in English."

A variant of this method has previously been applied to context-free grammar based formalisms such as UVG-DL."

We claim that effective text planners must explicitly model aspects of the Hearer's cognitive state, such as what the hearer is attending to and what inferences the hearer can draw, in order to make these choices. We argue that a mere representation of the Hearer's knowledge is inadequate. We support this claim by (1) an analysis of naturally occurring dialogue, and (2) by simulating the generation of discourses in a situation in which we can vary the cognitive parameters of the hearer. Our results show that modeling cognitive state can lead to more effective discourses (measured with respect to a simple task)."
