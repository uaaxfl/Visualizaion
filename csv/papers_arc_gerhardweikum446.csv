A notable trait is the inclusion of media such as images placed at meaningful locations within a textual narrative. Most often, such images are accompanied by captions - either factual or stylistic (humorous, metaphorical, etc.) - making the narrative more engaging to the reader. While standalone image captioning has been extensively studied, captioning an image based on external knowledge such as its surrounding text remains under-explored. In this paper, we study this new task: given an image and an associated unstructured knowledge snippet, the goal is to generate a contextual caption for the image."

We construct RedDust using a diverse set of high-precision patterns and demonstrate its use as a resource for developing learning models to deal with implicit assertions. RedDust consists of users{'} personal traits, which are (attribute, value) pairs, along with users{'} post ids, which may be used to retrieve the posts from a publicly available crawl or from the Reddit API.

Specifically, we aim to extract entities and their relationships from sentences in the form of triples and map the elements of the extracted triples to an existing KB in an end-to-end manner. Previous studies focus on the extraction itself and rely on Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) to map triples into the KB space. This way, NED errors may cause extraction errors that affect the overall precision and recall.To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end relation extraction model for KB enrichment based on a neural encoder-decoder model. We collect high-quality training data by distant supervision with co-reference resolution and paraphrase detection. We propose an n-gram based attention model that captures multi-word entity names in a sentence. Our model employs jointly learned word and entity embeddings to support named entity disambiguation.

An important problem in this context is cross-document co-reference resolution (CCR): computing equivalence classes of textual mentions denoting the same entity, within and across documents. Prior methods employ ranking, clustering, or probabilistic graphical models using syntactic features and distant features from knowledge bases. However, these methods exhibit limitations regarding run-time and robustness. This paper presents the CROCS framework for unsupervised CCR, improving the state of the art in two ways. First, we extend the way knowledge bases are harnessed, by constructing a notion of semantic summaries for intra-document co-reference chains using co-occurring entity mentions belonging to different chains. Second, we reduce the computational cost by a new algorithm that embeds sample-based bisection, using spectral clustering or graph partitioning, in a hierarchical clustering process. This allows scaling up CCR to large corpora. Experiments with three datasets show significant gains in output quality, compared to the best prior methods, and the run-time efficiency of CROCS."

This paper proposes C3EL, an unsupervised framework combining CCR and NEL for jointly tackling both problems. C3EL incorporates results from the CCR stage into NEL, and vice versa: additional global context obtained from CCR improves the feature space and performance of NEL, while NEL in turn provides distant KB features for already disambiguated mentions to improve CCR. The CCR and NEL steps are interleaved in an iterative algorithm that focuses on the highest-confidence still unresolved mentions in each iteration. Experimental results on two different corpora, news-centric and web-centric, demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines for both CCR and NEL."

Within such a multi-level type hierarchy with several hundreds of types at different levels, many entities naturally belong to multiple types. In order to achieve high-precision in type classification, current approaches are either limited to certain domains or require time consuming multistage computations. As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy."

However, a largely under-explored case is tapping into highly dynamic sources like news streams and social media, where new entities are continuously emerging. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and semantically typing newly emerging out-ofKB entities, thus improving the freshness and recall of ontology-based IE and improving the precision and semantic rigor of open IE. Our method is based on a probabilistic model that feeds weights into integer linear programs that leverage type signatures of relational phrases and type correlation or disjointness constraints. Our experimental evaluation, based on crowdsourced user studies, show our method performing significantly better than prior work."

P12-2046,Coupling Label Propagation and Constraints for Temporal Fact Extraction,2012,20,18,4,0,13257,yafang wang,Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),0,"The Web and digitized text sources contain a wealth of information about named entities such as politicians, actors, companies, or cultural landmarks. Extracting this information has enabled the automated construction of large knowledge bases, containing hundred millions of binary relationships or attribute values about these named entities. However, in reality most knowledge is transient, i.e. changes over time, requiring a temporal dimension in fact extraction. In this paper we develop a methodology that combines label propagation with constraint reasoning for temporal fact extraction. Label propagation aggressively gathers fact candidates, and an Integer Linear Program is used to clean out false hypotheses that violate temporal constraints. Our method is able to improve on recall while keeping up with precision, which we demonstrate by experiments with biography-style Wikipedia pages and a large corpus of news articles."
D12-1014,A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts,2012,32,15,3,1,7403,lizhen qu,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,0,"We propose the weakly supervised Multi-Experts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews. In contrast to most prior work, MEM predicts both opinion polarity and opinion strength at the level of individual sentences; such fine-grained analysis helps to understand better why users like or dislike the entity under review. A key challenge in this setting is that it is hard to obtain sentence-level training data for both polarity and strength. For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data. We integrate these noisy indicators into a unified probabilistic framework using ideas from ensemble learning and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Our experiments indicate that MEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin."

Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages is tedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task, this paper presents a methodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queries over linked-data sources.n n Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve several disambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping of phrases to semantic entities, classes, and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triple patterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in the web of linked data, to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function. We present experiments on both the question translation and the resulting query answering."

Prior work has focused on flat and relatively small type systems where most entities belong to exactly one type. This paper addresses very fine-grained types organized in a hierarchical taxonomy, with several hundreds of types at different levels. We present HYENA for multi-label hierarchical classification. HYENA exploits gazetteer features and accounts for the joint evidence for types at different levels. Experiments and an extrinsic study on NED demonstrate the practical viability of HYENA."

This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs."

Unfortunately, large numbers of links are imprecise or simply wrong. In this paper, techniques to detect such problems are identified. We formalize their removal as an optimization task based on graph repair operations. We then present an algorithm with provable properties that uses linear programming and a region growing technique to tackle this challenge. This allows us to transform Wikipedia into a much more consistent multilingual register of the world's entities and concepts."

In this paper, we discuss techniques to respond to a user's lexical queries by providing multilingual and multimodal information, and facilitating navigating along different types of links. To this end, structured information from sources like WordNet, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, as well as Web services is linked and integrated to provide a multi-faceted yet consistent response to user queries. The meanings of words in many different languages are characterized by mapping them to appropriate WordNet sense identifiers and adding multilingual gloss descriptions as well as example sentences. Relationships are derived from WordNet and Wiktionary to allow users to discover semantically related words, etymologically related words, alternative spellings, as well as misspellings. Last but not least, images, audio recordings, and geographical maps extracted from Wikipedia and Wiktionary allow for a multimodal experience."
C10-1103,The Bag-of-Opinions Method for Review Rating Prediction from Sparse Text Patterns,2010,26,103,3,1,7403,lizhen qu,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2010),0,"The problem addressed in this paper is to predict a user's numeric rating in a product review from the text of the review. Unigram and n-gram representations of text are common choices in opinion mining. However, unigrams cannot capture important expressions like could have been better, which are essential for prediction models of ratings. N-grams of words, on the other hand, capture such phrases, but typically occur too sparsely in the training set and thus fail to yield robust predictors. This paper overcomes the limitations of these two models, by introducing a novel kind of bag-of-opinions representation, where an opinion, within a review, consists of three components: a root word, a set of modifier words from the same sentence, and one or more negation words. Each opinion is assigned a numeric score which is learned, by ridge regression, from a large, domain-independent corpus of reviews. For the actual test case of a domain-dependent review, the review's rating is predicted by aggregating the scores of all opinions in the review and combining it with a domain-dependent unigram model. The paper presents a constrained ridge regression algorithm for learning opinion scores. Experiments show that the bag-of-opinions method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques for review rating prediction."

When a word has multiple meanings, it is useful to have example sentences for specific senses (and hence definitions) of that word rather than indiscriminately lumping all of them together. In this paper, we investigate to what extent such sense-specific example sentences can be extracted from parallel corpora using lexical knowledge bases for multiple languages as a sense index. We use word sense disambiguation heuristics and a cross-lingual measure of semantic similarity to link example sentences to specific word senses. From the sentences found for a given sense, an algorithm then selects a smaller subset that can be presented to end users, taking into account both representativeness and diversity. Preliminary results show that a precision of around 80% can be obtained for a reasonable number of word senses, and that the subset selection yields convincing results."
