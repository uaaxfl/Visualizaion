The response involves evaluating village proximity and sorting responses, e.g. by increasing distance from Meg`eve. The first part of the response There are no bungalows in Meg`eve is the direct response, which corrects the user false presupposition, while the remainder of the response reflects the cooperative know-how of the responder. Cooperative know-how involves several forms of responses that include relaxations, intensional calculus, expression of restrictions, of warnings and conditional responses (Benamara et al. 2004). This simple example shows that, if a direct response cannot be found, several forms of knowledge and reasoning schemas need to be used and that the NL form of the response requires adequate and subtle lexicalisations, often directed by the reasoning schemas. Lexicalisation is the operation that associates a word or an expression to a concept. It is a major parameter in response production (Reiter et Dale, 1997), (a good synthesis can be found in (Cahill, 1999)). Lexicalisation is often decomposed into two different stages: lexical choice, which occurs during content determination, where the"

These documents are designed to be easy to read and as efficient and unambiguous as possible for their users. They must leave little space for personal interpretations. For that purpose, they tend to follow relatively strict controlled natural language (CNL hereafter) principles concerning both their form and contents (Fuchs 2012), (Kuhn 2014) (Aurora et ali. 2013). These principles are described in documents called authoring guidelines. These are general purpose statements, norms in e.g. aeronautics, chemistry, or considerations proper to a company. Guidelines contain some details about e.g. the terms which can be used (for example, a limited subset of verbs) or not and syntactic structures which are allowed or preferred.

These MUs are characterized by markers which are general terms, domain independent for most of them. The study of these marks for French reveals that there is little marker overlap between units. Markers have been defined in a first stage from corpus analysis and then generalized to similar terms in order to have a larger basis for evaluation. We also used, to a limited extend, a bootstrapping technique to get more data (Ravinchandran and Hovy 2002), a method that starts by an unambiguous set of anchors (often arguments of a relational term) for a target sense. Searching text fragments on the Web based on these anchors then produces a number of ways of relating these anchors. Let us now characterize linguistic markers for each of these categories: Restrictions (AR) are an important unit in cooperative discourse. There is a quite large literature in linguistics about the expression of restrictions. In cooperative discourse, the expression of restrictions is realized quite straightforwardly by a small number of classes of terms: (a) restri"

Let us finally note a few NLG-oriented papers centered on the generation of arguments such as [22], which focus on generic types of arguments (ad absurdum, from cases, etc.) and [8]. 3 A Discursive analysis of procedural texts The complexity of procedural texts leads us to proceed very gradually in the study of their structure before being able to produce even simple such texts. At an intermediate level, responding in natural language to questions, using underspecified templates is an interesting step which can be evaluated.

We have developed a detailed analysis of procedural texts from a manual corpus analysis, identifying their main basic components as well as their global structure. For that purpose, we have defined two levels: a segmentation level that basically identifies structures considered as terminal structures (titles, instructions, prerequisites, connectors, etc.) and a grammar level that binds these terminal structures to give a global structure to procedural texts (Delpech et al. 2008). This structure is textual and dedicated only to elements relevant to procedurality. To design the grammar, we have borrowed a few considerations from Minimalist syntax, in particular recent developments of X-bar syntax and notions like merge. This point will not be developed here (but see Delpech et al. 2007). Note that text grammars are generally in a relatively early development stage (Webber 2004, Gardent 1997). Procedural texts are complex structures, they often exhibit a quite complex rational (the instructions) and ’irrational’ structure which is mainly composed out of pieces of advice"

For empty supports corresponding to general requirements, we infer a generic support based on those requirements, e.g.: mounting your computer: use a flat and clean surface. induced support: ’for a better ease of execution’. From our observations (which need further confirmation), generic supports are in general triggered by adjectives or by general purpose verbs used in the conclusion. The second situation (empty support in a domain dependent situation) is more delicate and requires domain or lexical knowledge. We are investigating the use of principles of the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1991) for that purpose. Very briefly, wind has in its telic role several predicates like push, take away, scatter, disperse, break, damage, .... When applied e.g. to gardening, such as planting new flowers, since these are not so mobile when planted, a predicate like break or damage can be 126 Fontan and Saint-Dizier selected (selection principles in the Generative lexicon remain however an open and very delicate problem).

We finally investigate their contribution to the structure and the understanding of procedural texts. 115 116 Fontan and Saint-Dizier 1 Introduction The main goal of our project is to analyze the structure of procedural texts in order to efficiently and accurately respond to How-to-do-X? questions. This means identifying titles (which convey the main goals of the procedure), sequences of instructions serving these goals, and a number of additional structures such as prerequisites, warnings, advice, illustrations, etc. (Takechi et al. 2003, Adam, 2001). A response to an How-to question is then the well-formed text portion within the scope of the title that matches the question. In our perspective, procedural texts range from apparently simple cooking recipes to large maintenance manuals. They also include documents as diverse as teaching texts, medical notices, social behavior recommendations, directions for use, assembly notices, do-it-yourself notices, itinerary guides, advice texts, savoir-faire guides etc. (Aouladomar et al., 2005).

Argument mining research applies to written texts, e.g. (Mochales Palau et ali.., 2009), (Kirschner et ali., 2015), for example for opinion analysis, e.g. (Villalba et al., 2012), mediation analysis (Janier et al. 2015) or transcribed argumentative dialog analysis, e.g. (Budzynska et ali., 2014), (Swanson et ali., 2015). The analysis of the NLP techniques relevant for argument mining from annotated structures is analyzed in e.g. (Peldszus et al. 2016). Annotated corpora are now available, e.g. the AIFDB dialog corpora or (Walker et al., 2012). These corpora are very useful to understand how argumentation is realized in texts, e.g. to identify argumentative discourse units (ADUs), linguistic cues (Nguyen et al., 2015), and argumentation strategies, in a concrete way, possibly in association with abstract argumentation schemes, as shown in e.g. (Feng et al., 2011). In natural language generation, argument generation started as early as (Zuckerman et ali. 2000). Finally, reasoning aspects related to argumentation analysis are developed in e.g. (Fiedler et al., 2007) and (Winterstein, 2012) from a formal semantics perspective. Abstrac"

Due to its limited size, this paper outlines the main features of the implementation, while references point to additional material. This short paper presents a first implementation of a knowledge-driven argument mining approach. The major processing steps and language resources of the system are surveyed. An indicative evaluation outlines challenges and improvement directions. 1 Introduction This paper presents a first implementation of a knowledge-driven argument mining approach based on the principles developed in (Saint-Dizier 2016). This knowledge based approach to argument mining was felt to be challenging because of the heavy load put on knowledge description and acquisition, inference pattern development and implementation complexity. The aim of this paper is to introduce an architecture for the implementation, to structure the different sources of data: lexical, knowledge base and inferences, and to explore how the data can be specified or acquired. We feel that this approach allows to develop in the middle and long term an accurate argument mining system that can identify arguments in any type of text given a stand"

Type 2 titles could help answering specific questions. One remaining difficulty for question-title matching is that titles have often a very elliptic structure. 68 3.3 Recognizing instructions and instructional compounds While working on corpora, we noted that what is usually called an instruction ranges from clearly injunctive clauses to implicit prescriptions (Talmy 2001) (this complexity is reflected in the complexity of our manual annotation tasks). Instructions are recognized (Delpech et al. 2008) on the basis of two factors: contents, around action verbs in certain forms to identify an instruction and typographic factors for its delimitation (beginning and end) via html tags, punctuation marks or connectors. Currently, we use a set of only 14 lexico-morphological patterns that encompass the most prototypical ways of expressing instructions. We use lexical resources such as action verbs, incentive verbs, nouns and adjectives. They must have in French specific forms: imperative, infinitive, modal + infinitive, dummy pronoun &apos;on&apos; + finite verb (this pattern has a semantic restriction: on"

The different steps which have been completed so far are presented in (Albert et al. 2009a; Albert et al. 2009b; Albert et al. in press). We have collected a corpus of documents ranging from short, spontaneous productions (e.g. emails, forum posts, etc.) to long, professional productions (e.g. papers, reports, etc.). We found the existence of a quasi-continuum in the levels of control which can be observed in these documents, i.e. in the amount of care devoted to their production. Levels of control vary according to document type, e.g. emails are written with less care than scientific publications, but also among one type of documents, e.g. emails written to supervisors are given"
