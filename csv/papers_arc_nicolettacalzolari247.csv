META-SHARE was developed by META-NET (www.meta-net.eu) and aims to serve as an important component of a language technology marketplace for researchers, developers, professionals and industrial players, catering for the full development cycle of language technology, from research through to innovative products and services. The observed usage in its initial steps, the steadily increasing number of network nodes, resources, users, queries, views and downloads are all encouraging and considered as supportive of the choices made so far. In tandem, take-up activities like direct linking and processing of datasets by language processing services as well as metadata transformation to RDF are expected to open new avenues for data and resources linking and boost the organic growth of the infrastructure while facilitating language technology deployment by much wider research communities and industrial sectors."

To address the complexities hidden in multilayer interrelations even small amounts of processed data can be useful, improving the performance of complex systems. Exploiting the current trend towards sharing we want to initiate a collective movement that works towards creating synergies and harmonisation among different annotation efforts that are now dispersed. In this paper we present the general architecture of the Language Library, an initiative which is conceived as a facility for gathering and making available through simple functionalities the linguistic knowledge the field is able to produce, putting in place new ways of collaboration within the LRT community. In order to reach this goal, a first population round of the Language Library has started around a core of parallel/comparable texts that have been annotated by several contributors submitting a paper for LREC2012. The Language Library has also an ancillary aim related to language documentation and archiving and it is conceived as a theory-neutral space which allows for several language processing philosophies to coexist."

The central idea behind the service design is: given a query, the primary functionality of lexicon access is to present a partial lexicon by extracting the relevant part of the target lexicon. Based on this idea, we implemented the system as a RESTful Web service whose input query is specified by the access URI and whose output is presented in a standardized XML data format. LMF, an ISO standard for modeling lexicons, plays the most prominent role: the access URI pattern basically reflects the lexicon structure as defined by LMF; the access results are rendered based on Wordnet-LMF, which is a version of LMF XML-serialization. The Web service currently provides accesses to Princeton WordNet, Japanese WordNet, as well as the EDR Electronic Dictionary as a trial. To accommodate the EDR dictionary within the same framework, we modeled it also as a WordNet-type semantic lexicon. This paper thus argues possible alternatives to model innately bilingual/multilingual lexicons like EDR with LMF, and proposes possible revisions to Wordnet-LMF."

The BioLexicon is a large-scale lexical-terminological resource encoding different information types in one single integrated resource. In the design of the resource we follow the ISO/DIS 24613 ÂLexical Mark-up FrameworkÂ standard, which ensures reusability of the information encoded and easy exchange of both data and architecture. The design of the resource also takes into account the needs of our text mining partners who automatically extract syntactic and semantic information from texts and feed it to the lexicon. The present contribution first describes in detail the model of the BioLexicon along its three main layers: morphology, syntax and semantics; then, it briefly describes the database implementation of the model and the population strategy followed within the project, together with an example. The BioLexicon database in fact comes equipped with automatic uploading procedures based on a common exchange XML format, which guarantees that the lexicon can be properly populated with data coming from different sources."

In such a language infrastructure, an access function to a lexical resource, embodied as an atomic Web service, plays a crucially important role in composing a composite Web service tailored to a userÂs specific requirement. To facilitate the composition process involving service discovery, planning and invocation, the language infrastructure should be ontology-based; hence the ontologization of a range of lexicon functions is highly required. In a service-oriented environment, lexical resources however can be classified from a service-oriented perspective rather than from a lexicographically motivated standard. Hence to address the issue of interoperability, the taxonomy for lexical resources should be ground to principled and shared lexicon ontology. To do this, we have ontologized the standardized lexicon modeling framework LMF, and utilized it as a foundation to stipulate the service-oriented lexicon taxonomy and the corresponding ontology for lexicon access functions. This paper also examines a possible solution to fill the gap between the ontological descriptions and the actual Web service API by adopting a W3C recommendation SAWSDL, with which Web service descriptions can be linked with the domain ontology."

To this end, we have designed a lexical flow (LF) corresponding to the scenario where an entry of a lexicon A becomes enriched via basically two steps. First, by virtue of being mapped onto a corresponding entry belonging to a lexicon B, the entry(LA) inherits the semantic relations available in lexicon B. Second, by resorting to an automatic application that acquires information about semantic relations from corpora, the relations acquired are integrated into the entry and proposed to the human encoder. As a result of the lexical flow, in addition, for each starting lexical entry(LA) mapped onto a corresponding entry(LB) the flow produces a new entry representing the merging of the original two."

Introduction After considering the strategic and infrastructural role of Language Resources (LRs) within any Human Language Technology (HLT) application (section 1), we focus on the main issues discussed within the ENABLER (European National Activities for Basic Language Resources) Thematic Network (section 2): the survey of LRs, interoperability and multilinguality, open access to LRs, validation methodologies for LRs, industrial and basic requirements. Finally, few recommendations are provided towards the design of general strategies and an overall coordination for the field of LRs (section 3). 1. The Strategic Role of LRs Language Resources (LRs) xe2x80x93 Written, Spoken and, recently, Multimodal xe2x80x93 are a central and strategic component of the so-called xe2x80x9clinguistic infrastructurexe2x80x9d (the other key element being Evaluation), necessary for the development of any Human Language Technology (HLT) application and product. The availability of adequate LRs for as many languages as possible is a pre-requisite for the development of a truly multilingual Information Society. They play a critical role, as horizontal technology, in different areas of the 6 Framework Programme, and have been recognized as a priority within a number of national projects around Europe. The availability of LRs is also a xe2x80x9csensitivexe2x80x9d issue, touching directly the sphere of linguistic and cultural identity, but also with economical, societal and political implications. This is going to be even more true in the new Europe with 25 languages on a par. The ENABLER Thematic Network of HLT National Projects in European countries xe2x80x93 an EC funded IST project, designed and started by Antonio Zampolli, with a clear strategic vision for the field of LRs xe2x80x93 is the first broad European initiative which has the mission of explicitly considering together the technical, organizational, strategic and political issues of LRs. In ENABLER these various aspects are put together in a coherent framework, to set up mediumand long-term set of priorities (both technical and strategic) and to promote these at the national and international levels. Moreover, ENABLER has recognized the importance to promote actions aiming at integrating the different resource types, until now developed independently, and xe2x80x93 as a consequence xe2x80x93 at promoting the cooperation between the communities of Speech, Text and Multimodality. In the following we briefly highlight the main issues tackled by ENABLER on the different layers. 2. The Main Issues 2.1.

At syntactic level, we show how alternating structures may be encoded in a linguistically more elegant way by using framesets. We illustrate the connection between syntactic and semantic information, and show how the SIMPLE Italian lexicon approach to predicate selection has been refined in CLIPS. At semantic level, we illustrate the richness of information types encoded in a word sense description and the way such a wealth of data can be exploited. We stress in particular the expressive power of the Extended Qualia Structure yet mentioning some of its problematic aspects. We show that queries on qualia relations allow to retrieve lexical collocates, to extract domain specific information, semantic networks, and help interpreting modifying PPs in complex nominals. Finally, we show that features, which cut across the type hierarchy, have a stronger expressive power with respect to semantic types in identifying selectional preferences."

Within the XMELLT and ISLE projects we have started to investigate the potential to develop multi-lingual, multi-word expression lexicons incorporating both syntactic and semantic information. We aim at specifying means to acquire and represent multi-word lexical entries for multiple languages, and establishing uniform (or inter-translatable) standards for describing multi-word lexical entries. We explored theoretical approaches used in large lexicon-building projects, in p articular FrameNet and SIMPLE. They constitute interesting frameworks for the explicit syntactic and semantic representation of MWEs, due mainly to their ability to capture semantic multidimensionality, through frame e lements and qualia relations respectively.

In this paper we present some observations and results concerning an experiment of manual lexical-semantic tagging of a small Italian corpus performed within the framework of the ELSNET project. The ELSNET experimental project has to be considered as a feasibility study. It is part of a preparatory and training phase, started with the Romanseval/Senseval experiment (Calzolari et al., 1998), and ending up with the lexical-semantic annotation of larger quantities of semantically annotated texts such as the syntacticsemantic Treebank which is going to be annotated within an Italian National Project (SI-TAL).

Nowadays, SIMPLE lexicons are monolingual although the ultimate goal of these harmonised monolingual lexicons is to build multilingual lexical resources. For achieving this goal it is necessary to automatise the linking among the different senses of the different monolingual lexicons, as the production of such multilingual relations by hand will be, as all tasks related with the development of linguistic resources, unaffordable in terms of human resources and time spent. The system we describe in this paper takes advantage of the SIMPLE model and the SIMPLE based lexicons so that, in the best case, it can find fully automatically the relevant sense-to-sense correspondences for determining the translational equivalence of two words in two different languages and, in the worst case, it will be able to narrow the set of admissible links between words and relevant senses. This paper also explores to what extent semantic encoding in already existing computational lexicons such as SIMPLE can help in overcoming the problems arisen when using monolingual meaning descriptions for bilingual links and aims to set the basis for defining a model for adding a bilingual layer to the SIMPLE model. This bilingual layer based on a bilingual relation model will be the basis indeed for defining the multilingual language resource we want PAROLE-SIMPLE lexicons to become."

Reaching a common agreed model grounded on sound theoretical approaches within a very large consortium is in itself a challenging task. The actual lexicons will then provide a framework for testing and evaluating the maturity of the current state-of-the-art in lexical semantics grounded on, and connected to. a syntactic foundation.

We are well aware that, in order to build a more powel-ful I.DB (or even a Le.'dcal Knowledge Base) to be used in different ComputationM l.inguistics (CL) applications, types of information other than those usually found in machine readable dictionaries are urgently needed. Different sources of information must therefore be exploited if we wemt to overcome the 'qchcal bottleneck ~ of Natural l..anguage Processing ( N I P ) . In a trend which is becoming increasingly relevant both m c1 proper and in Literao and Iinguistic Computing, we feel that very interesting data ibr our LI)Bs c:m be found b.v processing large textuM corpora, where the actual usage of the language can be truly investigated. Many research projects are nowadays collecting large amounts of textuM data, thus providing more and more material to be analyzed for descriptions based on measurable evidence of how language is actually used. We uhhnately aim at integrating lexical data extracted from the an',dysis of large textual corpora into the I,DB we are implementing. These data refer, typically, to: i) complementation relations introduced by prepositions (e.g. dividere subcategorizes for a PP headed by the preposition in ha one sense, and by the preposition fra in another sense); ii) lexically conditioned modification relations (tena macchina potente , un farmaco potente and not /brte , while un cajfe forte , una moneta forte and not potente ); iii) lefically significant collocations (premiere ut~a decisione and not fare z~na decisione , prestare attenzione and not dare ); iv) fixed phrases and idioms I (donna itz carriera, dottorato di ricerca, a propo~ito di); v) compounds ( tarola calda, ~ave scuo/a). All these types of data are a major issue of practical relevance, and particularly problematic, in many N I P applications in different areas. They should therefore be dvcn very lm'ge coverage in any useful LDB, and, moreover, should also be annotated, in a computerk,'ed lexicon, for the pe~inent t)equency information obtained fiom the processed corpus, and obviously updated flom time to time. As a matter of fact, dictionaries now tend to encode all the theoreticcd possibilities on a same level, but if e ; 'e~ possibility in the diction:m, must be given equal weight, parsing is very diificult (Church 1988, p.3): they should provide infornaation on what is more likely to occur, e.g. relative likelihood of alternate pm-ts of speech for a word or of ahernate word-senses, both out of context and it possible taking into account contextu~d factors. Statistical anMyses of linguistic data were very popular in the 50s and '60s, mainly, even though not only, for literary types of analyses and for studies on the lexicon (Guiraud 1959, Muller 1964, Moskovich 1977). Stochastic approaches to linguistic analyses have been strongly reevaluated in the past few years, either for syntactic analysis (Gm'side et al. 1987, Church 1988), or for NLP applications (Brown et al. 1988), or for semantic analysis (Zemik 1989, Smadja 1989). Quantitative (not statistical) evidence on e.g. word-sense occurrences in a large corpus have been taken into account for lexicographic descriptions (Cobuild 1%7)."

The dictionary is considered in this framework as a primary source of basic general knowledge. In the paper we describe a project to develop a system which has word-sense acquisition from information contained in computerized dictionaries and knowledge organization as its main objectives. The approach consists in a discovery procedure technique operating on natural language definitions, which is recursively applied and refined. We start from free-text definitions, in natural language linear form, analyzing and converting them into informationally equivalent structured forms.
