This may be sufficient if the goal is to detect and delete abusive language posts. However, removal is not always possible due to the legislation of a country. Also, there is evidence that hate speech cannot be successfully combated by merely removing hate speech posts; they should be countered by education and counter-narratives. For this purpose, we need to identify (i) who is the target in a given hate speech post, and (ii) what aspects (or characteristics) of the target are attributed to the target in the post. As the first approximation, we propose to adapt a generic state-of-the-art concept extraction model to the hate speech domain. The outcome of the experiments is promising and can serve as inspiration for further work on the task"

While many of them target the identification of hate speech or fake news, there are others that address, e.g., text simplification to alleviate consequences of dyslexia, or coaching strategies to fight depression. However, so far, there is no clear picture of what areas are targeted by NLP4SG, who are the actors, which are the main scenarios and what are the topics that have been left aside. In order to obtain a clearer view in this respect, we first propose a working definition of NLP4SG and identify some primary aspects that are crucial for NLP4SG, including, e.g., areas, ethics, privacy and bias. Then, we draw upon a corpus of around 50,000 articles downloaded from the ACL Anthology. Based on a list of keywords retrieved from the literature and revised in view of the task, we select from this corpus articles that can be considered to be on NLP4SG according to our definition and analyze them in terms of trends along the time line, etc. The result is a map of the current NLP4SG research and insights concerning the white spots on this map."

However, while pretraining methods are very convenient, they are expensive in terms of time and resources. This calls for a study of the impact of pretraining data size on the knowledge of the models. We explore this impact on the syntactic capabilities of RoBERTa, using models trained on incremental sizes of raw text data. First, we use syntactic structural probes to determine whether models pretrained on more data encode a higher amount of syntactic information. Second, we perform a targeted syntactic evaluation to analyze the impact of pretraining data size on the syntactic generalization performance of the models. Third, we compare the performance of the different models on three downstream applications: part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and paraphrase identification. We complement our study with an analysis of the cost-benefit trade-off of training such models. Our experiments show that while models pretrained on more data encode more syntactic knowledge and perform better on downstream applications, they do not always offer a better performance across the different syntactic phenomena and come at a higher financial and environmental cost."

Understanding their degree of compositionality and idiosyncrasy, as well their underlying semantics, is crucial for language learners, lexicographers and downstream NLP applications. In this paper, we perform an exhaustive analysis of current language models for collocation understanding. We first construct a dataset of apparitions of lexical collocations in context, categorized into 17 representative semantic categories. Then, we perform two experiments: (1) unsupervised collocate retrieval using BERT, and (2) supervised collocation classification in context. We find that most models perform well in distinguishing light verb constructions, especially if the collocation{'}s first argument acts as subject, but often fail to distinguish, first, different syntactic structures within the same semantic category, and second, fine-grained semantic categories which restrict the use of small sets of valid collocates for a given base."

Among other information, it has been shown that entire syntax trees are implicitly embedded in the geometry of such models.

In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the embedded syntax trees along the fine-tuning process of BERT for six different tasks, covering all levels of the linguistic structure. Experimental results show that the encoded syntactic information is forgotten (PoS tagging), reinforced (dependency and constituency parsing) or preserved (semantics-related tasks) in different ways along the fine-tuning process depending on the task."

Different datasets were annotated and classified by means of applying different machine learning algorithms. However, few efforts were done in order to clarify the applied categories and homogenize different datasets. Our study takes up this demand. We analyze six different publicly available datasets in this field with respect to their similarity and compatibility. We conduct two different experiments. First, we try to make the datasets compatible and represent the dataset classes as Fast Text word vectors analyzing the similarity between different classes in a intra and inter dataset manner. Second, we submit the chosen datasets to the Perspective API Toxicity classifier, achieving different performances depending on the categories and datasets. One of the main conclusions of these experiments is that many different definitions are being used for equivalent concepts, which makes most of the publicly available datasets incompatible. Grounded in our analysis, we provide guidelines for future dataset collection and annotation."

Furthermore, if built modularly, they can be ported to other genres and languages with a limited amount of work, without the need of the annotation of a considerable amount of training data. One of these generators is FORGe, which is based on the Meaning-Text Model. In the recent WebNLG challenge (the first comprehensive task addressing the mapping of RDF triples to text) FORGe ranked first with respect to the overall quality in human evaluation. We extend the coverage of FORGE{'}s open source grammatical and lexical resources for English, so as to further improve the English texts, and port them to Spanish, to achieve a comparable quality. This confirms that, as already observed in the case of SimpleNLG, a robust universal grammar-driven framework and a systematic organization of the linguistic resources can be an adequate choice for NLG applications."

To successfully cope with it, machine learning are applied. However, ML-based techniques require sufficiently large annotated datasets. In the last years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper, we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far. The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly, non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels ({`}hate{'} vs. {`}no-hate{'}). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified data, with a state-of-the-art outcome."

First, we introduce a novel dataset with collocations categorized according to lexical functions. Second, we conduct experiments on a subset of this benchmark, comparing it in particular to the well known DiffVec dataset. In these experiments, in addition to simple word vector arithmetic operations, we also investigate the role of unsupervised relation vectors as a complementary input. While these relation vectors indeed help, we also show that lexical function classification poses a greater challenge than the syntactic and semantic relations that are typically used for benchmarks in the literature."

However, despite the advances of theoretical studies in speech prosody, so far, no large scale prosody annotated resources that would facilitate empirical research and the development of empirical computational approaches are available. This is to a large extent due to the fact that current common prosody annotation conventions offer a descriptive framework of intonation contours and phrasing based on labels. This makes it difficult to reach a satisfactory inter-annotator agreement during the annotation of gold standard annotations and, subsequently, to create consistent large scale annotations. To address this problem, we present an annotation schema for prominence and boundary labeling of prosodic phrases based upon acoustic parameters and a tagger for prosody annotation at the prosodic phrase level. Evaluation proves that inter-annotator agreement reaches satisfactory values, from 0.60 to 0.80 Cohen{'}s kappa, while the prosody tagger achieves acceptable recall and f-measure figures for five spontaneous samples used in the evaluation of monologue and dialogue formats in English and Spanish.

They have thus a great potential for such downstream applications as machine translation and summarization. In this demo paper, we propose an online version of a deep-syntactic parser that outputs deep-syntactic structures from plain sentences and visualizes them using the Brat tool. Along with the deep-syntactic structures, the user can also inspect the visual presentation of the surface-syntactic structures that serve as input to the deep-syntactic parser and that are produced by the joint tagger and syntactic transition-based parser ran in the pipeline before deep-syntactic parsing takes place."

So far, such a projection has been a challenge in data-driven genera- tion and was largely avoided. We present a fully stochastic generator that is able to cope with projection between non-isomorphic structures. The generator, which starts from PropBank-like structures, consists of a cas- cade of SVM-classifier based submodules that map in a series of transitions the input struc- tures onto sentences.

W14-3501,Improving Collocation Correction by Ranking Suggestions Using Linguistic Knowledge,2014,23,5,3,1,10809,roberto carlini,Proceedings of the third workshop on {NLP} for computer-assisted language learning,0,"The importance of collocations in the context of second language learning is generally acknowledged. Studies show that the xe2x80x9ccollocation density in learner corpora is nearly the same as in native corpora, i.e., that use of collocations by learners is as common as it is by native speakers, while the collocation error rate in learner corpora is about ten times as high as in native reference corpora. Therefore, CALL could be of great aid to support the learners for better mastering of collocations. However, surprisingly few works address specifically research on CALL-oriented collocation learning assistants that detect miscollocations in the writings of the learners and propose suggestions for their correction or that offer the learner the possibility to verify a word co-occurrence with respect to its correctness as collocation and obtain suggestions for its correction in case it is determined to be a miscollocation. This disregard is likely to be, on the one hand, due to the focus of the CALL research so far on grammatical matters, and, on the other hand, due to the complexity of the problem. In order to be able to provide an adequate correction of a miscollocation, the collocation learning assistant must xe2x80x9cguess the meaning that the learner intended to express. This makes it very different from grammar or spell checkers, which can draw on grammatical respectively orthographic regularities of a language. In this paper, we focus on the problem of the provision of a ranked list of correction suggestions in a context in which the learner submits a collocation for verification and obtains a list of correction suggestions in the case of a miscollocation. We show that the retrieval of the suggestions and their ranking benefits greatly from NLP techniques that provide the syntactic dependency structure and subcategorization information of the word co-occurrences and a weighted Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) that reflects the fact that in a collocation, it is the base that is subject of the free choice of the speaker, while the occurrence of the collocate is restricted by the base, i.e., that collocations are per se asymmetric."

The attempts to adapt them for generation resulted so far in a better performance of the realizers, but not yet in a genuinely semantic generation-oriented annotation schema. Our goal is to initiate a debate on how a generation suitable annotation schema should be defined. We define some general principles of a semantic generation-oriented annotation and propose an annotation schema that is based on these principles.

We investigate the effect of the variation of the number of grammatical relations in a tagset on the performance of dependency parsers. In order to obtain several levels of granularity of the annotation, we design a hierarchical annotation scheme exclusively based on syntactic criteria. The richest annotation contains 60 relations. The more coarse-grained annotations are derived from the richest. As a result, all annotations and thus also the performance of a parser trained on different annotations remain comparable. We carried out experiments with four state-of-the-art dependency parsers. The results support the claim that annotating with more fine-grained syntactic relations does not necessarily imply a significant loss of accuracy. We also show the limits of this approach by giving details on the fine-grained relations that do have a negative impact on the performance of the parsers."

This new information is modeled as an extended ontology on top of the domain ontology which is populated via inference rules. Content selection leverages the ontology-based description of the domain and is performed throughout the text planning at increasing levels of granularity. It includes a main topic selection phase that takes into account a simple user model, a set of heuristics, and semantic relations that link individuals of the KB. The heuristics are based on weights determined empirically by supervised learning on a corpus of summaries aligned with data.

The schema allows us to choose the level of the desired detail of annotation, which facilitates the use of the schema for corpus annotation for different languages and for different NLP applications. Thanks to the inclusion of semantico-syntactic tags into the schema, we can annotate a corpus not only with syntactic dependency structures, but also with valency patterns as they are usually found in separate treebanks such as PropBank and NomBank. Semantico-syntactic tags and the level of detail of the schema furthermore facilitate the derivation of deep-syntactic and semantic annotations, leading to truly multilevel annotated dependency corpora. Such multilevel annotations can be readily used for the task of ML-based acquisition of grammar resources that map between the different levels of linguistic representation â something which forms part of, for instance, any natural language text generator."

This paper presents a language independent methodology for automatically extracting bilingual lexicon entries from the web without the need of resources like parallel or comparable corpora, POS tagging, nor an initial bilingual lexicon. It is suitable for specialized domains where bilingual lexicon entries are scarce. The input for the process is a corpus in the source language to use as example of real usage of the units we need to translate. It is a two-step flow process because first we extract single-word units from the source language and then the multi-word units where the initial single units are instantiated. For each of the multi-word units, we see if they appear in texts from the web in the target language. The unit of the target language that appears more frequently across the sets of multi-word units is usually the correct translation of the initial single-word source language entry.

We propose a technique that is based on the restricted lexical cooccurrence (collocation) of query terms. We use the knowledge on collocations formed by query terms for two tasks: (i) document relevance clustering done in the first stage of local query expansion and (ii) choice of suitable expansion terms from the relevant document cluster.

Two features of collocations are decisive in connection with their representation in SpEWN: (i) they are variant-specific rather than synset-specific and (ii) depending on the degree of their idiosyncrasy, they may be generalized to a certain degree. These features are accounted for by introducing new structures into the SpEWN. These new structures are compatible with the general design principles of the EWN. Given that SpEWN and DICE reveal a diverging distinction of the senses of lexical items, prior to the introduction of collocations from DICE into SpEWN, the senses of the elements of collocations in SpEWN and DICE are aligned."
