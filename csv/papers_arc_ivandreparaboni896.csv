2020.lrec-1.154,Cross-domain Author Gender Classification in {B}razilian {P}ortuguese,2020,-1,-1,2,0,16912,rafael dias,Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,0,"Author profiling models predict demographic characteristics of a target author based on the text that they have written. Systems of this kind will often follow a single-domain approach, in which the model is trained from a corpus of labelled texts in a given domain, and it is subsequently validated against a test corpus built from precisely the same domain. Although single-domain settings are arguably ideal, this strategy gives rise to the question of how to proceed when no suitable training corpus (i.e., a corpus that matches the test domain) is available. To shed light on this issue, this paper discusses a cross-domain gender classification task based on four domains (Facebook, crowd sourced opinions, Blogs and E-gov requests) in the Brazilian Portuguese language. A number of simple gender classification models using word- and psycholinguistics-based features alike are introduced, and their results are compared in two kinds of cross-domain setting: first, by making use of a single text source as training data for each task, and subsequently by combining multiple sources. Results confirm previous findings related to the effects of corpus size and domain similarity in English, and pave the way for further studies in the field."

Some of these studies have also attempted to go beyond recognition by focusing on the early signs of these illnesses, and by analysing the users{'} publication history over time to potentially prevent further harm. The two kinds of study are of course overlapping, and often make use of supervised machine learning methods based on annotated corpora. However, as in many other fields, existing resources are largely devoted to English NLP, and there is little support for these studies in under resourced languages.To bridge this gap, in this paper we describe the initial steps towards building a novel resource of this kind - a corpus intended to support both the recognition of mental health issues and the temporal analysis of these illnesses - in the Brazilian Portuguese language, and initial results of a number of experiments in text classification addressing both tasks."

The present work addresses one such strategy - namely, the use of Big Five personality information about the target author - applied to the case of abstractive text summarization using neural sequence-to-sequence models. Initial results suggest that having access to personality information does lead to more accurate (or human-like) text summaries, and paves the way for more robust systems of this kind."

Existing work on AS includes a wide range of algorithmic solutions to the problem, but the recent availability of corpora annotated with referring expressions data suggests that corpus-based AS strategies become possible as well. In this work we tentatively discuss a number of AS strategies using both semantic and surface information obtained from a corpus of this kind. Relying on semantic information, we attempt to learn both global and individual AS strategies that could be applied to a standard AS algorithm in order to generate descriptions found in the corpus. As an alternative, and perhaps less traditional approach, we also use surface information to build statistical language models of the referring expressions that are most likely to occur in the corpus, and let the model probabilities guide attribute selection."

Among these, the use of statistical methods has been particularly successful, as in the so-called 'generate-and-select', or 2-stages architectures. Systems of this kind produce output strings from possibly underspecified input data by over-generating a large number of alternative realisations (often including ungrammatical candidate sentences.) These are subsequently ranked with the aid of a statistical language model, and the most likely candidate is selected as the output string. Statistical approaches may however face a number of difficulties. Among these, there is the issue of data sparseness, a problem that is particularly evident in cases such as our target language - Brazilian Portuguese - which is not only morphologically-rich, but relatively poor in NLP resources such as large, publicly available corpora. In this work we describe a first implementation of a shallow surface realisation system for this language that deals with the issue of data sparseness by making use of factored language models built from a (relatively) large corpus of Brazilian newspapers articles."

In a traditional machine learning approach, SINotas uses a data-text aligned corpus as training data for decision-tree induction. The current system comprises a series of classifiers that implement major Document Planning subtasks (namely, data interpretation, content selection, within- and between-sentence structuring), and a small surface realisation grammar of Brazilian Portuguese.

However, if we know in advance what the most likely output sentences are (e.g., because a corpus on the relevant application domain happens to be available), then corpus knowledge may be used to quickly deploy a surface realisation engine for small-scale applications, for which it may be sufficient to select a sentence (in natural language) that resembles the desired output, and then modify some or all of its constituents accordingly. In other words, the application may simply 'point to' an existing sentence in the corpus and specify only the changes that need to take place to obtain the desired surface string. In this paper we describe one such approach to surface realisation, in which we extract syntactically-structured templates from a target corpus, and use these templates to produce existing and modified versions of the target sentences by a combination of canned text and basic dependency-tree operations."

J07-2004,Generating Referring Expressions: Making Referents Easy to Identify,2007,28,60,1,1,16913,ivandre paraboni,Computational Linguistics,0,"It is often desirable that referring expressions be chosen in such a way that their referents are easy to identify. This article focuses on referring expressions in hierarchically structured domains, exploring the hypothesis that referring expressions can be improved by including logically redundant information in them if this leads to a significant reduction in the amount of search that is needed to identify the referent. Generation algorithms are presented that implement this idea by including logically redundant information into the generated expression, in certain well-circumscribed situations. To test our hypotheses, and to assess the performance of our algorithms, two controlled experiments with human subjects were conducted. The first experiment confirms that human judges have a preference for logically redundant expressions in the cases where our model predicts this to be the case. The second experiment suggests that readers benefit from the kind of logical redundancy that our algorithms produce, as measured in terms of the effort needed to identify the referent of the expression."
