Several studies have lent support to the idea that choosing syntactic criteria for assigning heads in dependency trees improves the performance of dependency parsers. This may be explained by postulating that syntactic approaches are generally more learnable. In this study, we test this hypothesis by comparing the performance of five parsing systems (both transition- and graph-based) on a selection of 21 treebanks, each in a {`}semantic{'} variant, represented by standard UD (Universal Dependencies), and a {`}syntactic{'} variant, represented by SUD (Surface-syntactic Universal Dependencies): unlike previously reported experiments, which considered learnability of {`}semantic{'} and {`}syntactic{'} annotations of particular constructions in vitro, the experiments reported here consider whole annotation schemes in vivo. Additionally, we compare these annotation schemes using a range of quantitative syntactic properties, which may also reflect their learnability. The results of the experiments show that SUD tends to be more learnable than UD, but the advantage of one or the other scheme depends on the parser and the corpus in question."

We report on experiments showing the low inter-annotator agreement when using such systems and suggest that, at least in case of languages with rich morphosyntax, an approximation of semantic roles derived from syntactic (grammatical functions) and morphosyntactic (grammatical cases) features of arguments may actually be beneficial for applications such as textual entailment."

Although Walenty is still being intensively developed, it is already by far the largest Polish valence dictionary, with around 8600 verbal lemmata and almost 39 000 valence schemata.

The approach builds on the idea of cross-lingual dependency projection. The presented method of acquiring dependency trees involves a weighting factor in the processes of projecting source dependency relations to target sentences and inducing well-formed target dependency trees from sets of projected dependency relations. Using a parallel corpus, source trees are transferred onto equivalent target sentences via an extended set of alignment links. Projected arcs are initially weighted according to the certainty of word alignment links. Then, arc weights are recalculated using a method based on the EM selection algorithm. Maximum spanning trees selected from EM-scored digraphs and labelled with appropriate grammatical functions constitute a target dependency treebank. Extrinsic evaluation shows that parsers trained on such a treebank may perform comparably to parsers trained on a manually developed treebank."

Statistics generated from a corpus annotated only at the morphosyntactic level are used as features in a Machine Learning classifier which is able to detect which heads of groups found by a shallow parser are likely to be connected by an edge in the complete parse tree. The approach reaches the precision of 89% and the recall of 65%, with an extra 6% recall, if only words present in the wordnet are considered."

LFG grammars minimally provide two levels of representation: constituent structure (c-structure) produced by context-free phrase structure rules and functional structure (f-structure) created by functional descriptions. The c-structure was based on a DCG grammar of Polish, while the f-structure level was mainly inspired by the available HPSG analyses of Polish. The morphosyntactic information needed to create a lexicon may be taken from one of the following resources: a morphological analyser, a treebank or a corpus. Valence information from the dictionary which accompanies the DCG grammar was converted so that subcategorisation is stated in terms of grammatical functions rather than categories; additionally, missing valence frames may be extracted from the treebank. The obtained grammar is evaluated using constructed testsuites (half of which were provided by previous grammars) and the treebank."

The work completed so far includes re-licensing of the two dictionaries and filling the new resource with the morphological data semi-automatically unified from both sources. The merging process is controlled by the collaborative dictionary development web application Ku{\'z}nia, also implemented within the project. The tool involves several advanced features such as using SGJP inflectional patterns for form generation, possibility of attaching dictionary labels and classification schemes to lexemes, dictionary source record and change tracking. Since SGJP and Morfologik are already used in a significant number of Natural Language Processing projects in Poland, we expect PoliMorf to become the Polish morphological dictionary of choice for many years to come."

It includes the complete tagset for syntactic words and the list of syntactic groups recognized in NKJP. The tagset defines grammatical classes and categories according to morphosyntactic and syntactic criteria only. Syntactic annotation in the National Corpus of Polish is limited to making constituents of combinations of words. Annotation depends on shallow parsing and manual post-editing of the results by annotators. Manual annotation is performed by two independents annotators, with a referee in cases of disagreement. The manually constructed grammar, both for syntactic words and for syntactic groups, is encoded in the shallow parsing system Spejd."

We also discuss some methodological strategies including the annotation of embedded, coordinated and discontinuous names. Our annotation platform consists of two main tools interconnected by converting facilities.

A customizable graphical tree editor TrEd, extended to our needs, provides an ergonomic environment for manual correction of annotations.

The formalism and the engine are more flexible than either the usual shallow parsing formalisms, which assume disambiguated input, or the usual unification-based formalisms, which couple disambiguation (via unification) with structure building. Current applications of Spejd include rule-based disambiguation, detection of multiword expressions, valence acquisition, and sentiment analysis. The functionality can be further extended by adding external lexical resources. While the examples are based on the set of rules prepared for the parsing of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish, â  is fully language-independent and we hope it will also be useful in the processing of other languages."
