Research in Social Sciences and Humanities The use of LRs in language related research, education and technology development has evolved continuously over the past 40 years. Areas of inquiry considered impractical during the US “funding winter” enjoyed a subsequent period significant investment (Liberman 2011, 2015, Church 2017) that continues today and has yielded the successes in multiple HLTs that have in turn enabled their use in SSH research. Others are declared to be solved problems but them subsequently discovered to present unmet challenges (Xu et al. 2019, Cieri et al. 2018, Ryant et al. 2019). The emergence of new tools and methods create opportunities for SSH disciplines to adopt big data approaches. The most efficient of these build upon prior data intensive research including some undertaken outside 2 6. Conclusion Linguistic data centers have an obligation to promote the responsible reuse of LRs whether created for HLT or SSH (or other) research and whether used within or across disciplines. Data centers can meet these obligations by engaging with research communities to offer access to existing data, encourage data sharing, document corpus features that af"

One of the first publications released by LDC, the HCRC Map Task corpus (LDC93S12), was described as “a uniquely valuable resource for speech recognition research” (Anderson, et al. 1991, Thompson et al. 1993) by its creators who described themselves: “The group which designed and collected the corpus covers a wide range of interests and the corpus reflects this, providing a Notwithstanding the need and intent to share data across disciplinary boundaries, a potential user of ‘found data’ must recognize that most corpora have been designed to support specific research agendas.

The LAPPS Grid is part of a larger multiway international collaboration including key individuals and projects from the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Asia involved with language resource development and distribution and standards-making, who are creating the “The Federated Grid of Language Services” (FGLS) federation (Ishida et al., 2014), a multi-lingual, international network of web service grids and providers.

At the same time, clinical groups and the medical field are beginning to recognize the promise of LRs and HLTs not only in the mining and management of vast stores of text and speech data but also in the diagnosis and tracking of disorders and therapies. These shifts in emphasis should not, and generally are not, seen as proof that our communities have fully solved traditional problems such as multiword expression extraction (Schone & Jurafsky, 2001), language identification from text (da Silva & Lopes, 2006), speech synthesis (Sproat, 2010, p. 206) or speech recognition (Schwartz et al., 2011, p. 399) even in well-studied English.

A Grid Licensing Model Putting together the discussion to date, we propose the model in Figure 3 for managing licenses within a service grid framework. Specifically, this model benefits from features already implemented for the LAPPS Grid while imposing some limitations of its own. First, within the LAPPS Grid, users build pipelines using one of two workflow management tools developed by the project. The Composer, described in greater detail in Ide et al. 2014, displays for the user the set of available tool and data services allowing the user to select one or more, determine their order of application and even create branches to allow two or more tools of the same types to operate on the data in parallel so that their performance may be evaluated and compared. The Composer takes note of the input and output requirements of each tool in the chain and, in complex workflows, correctly routes data to appropriate processing services.

The NICT Language Grid did this by establishing a Service Grid Agreement. However, it is equally possible to construct a grid in which service providers are not the owners or developers of all the software they use to provide services. For example, within the US NSF-funded Language Application Grid, two of the principle service providers, Brandeis University and Vassar College, have created services based on third party software such as NLTK (Bird, Klein, Loper 2009) and the Stanford Toolkit (Manning et al., 2014). In this case, the service providers do not own the tools and thus cannot enter into agreements about the terms under which the software underlying their service may be used. As a solution, one might imagine providing software services under whatever licenses the underlying software has imposed and then constrain the users to comply with these terms. A third alternative would be to assume that all parties take responsibility for their own actions during grid operations and to impose no controls over either providers or users. The fourth option is of course to constrain both providers and user"
