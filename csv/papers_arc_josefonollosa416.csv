The task consists of building a system capable of translating English audio recordings extracted from TED talks into German text. Submitted systems can be either cascade or end-to-end and use a custom or given segmentation. Our submission is an end-to-end speech translation system, which combines pre-trained models (Wav2Vec 2.0 and mBART) with coupling modules between the encoder and decoder, and uses an efficient fine-tuning technique, which trains only 20{\%} of its total parameters. We show that adding an Adapter to the system and pre-training it, can increase the convergence speed and the final result, with which we achieve a BLEU score of 27.3 on the MuST-C test set. Our final model is an ensemble that obtains 28.22 BLEU score on the same set. Our submission also uses a custom segmentation algorithm that employs pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 for identifying periods of untranscribable text and can bring improvements of 2.5 to 3 BLEU score on the IWSLT 2019 test set, as compared to the result with the given segmentation."

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that is based on language-specific encoder-decoders, and can thus be more easily extended to new languages by learning their corresponding modules. So as to encourage a common interlingua representation, we simultaneously train the N initial languages. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the universal encoder-decoder by 3.28 BLEU points on average, while allowing to add new languages without the need to retrain the rest of the modules. All in all, our work closes the gap between shared and language-specific encoderdecoders, advancing toward modular multilingual machine translation systems that can be flexibly extended in lifelong learning settings."

We then used this dataset to train Spanish QA systems by fine-tuning a Multilingual-BERT model. Finally, we evaluated our QA models with the recently proposed MLQA and XQuAD benchmarks for cross-lingual Extractive QA. Experimental results show that our models outperform the previous Multilingual-BERT baselines achieving the new state-of-the-art values of 68.1 F1 on the Spanish MLQA corpus and 77.6 F1 on the Spanish XQuAD corpus.

The dominant approaches use subword-level tokens, but this increases the length of the sequences and makes it difficult to profit from word-level information such as POS tags or semantic dependencies. We propose a modification to the Transformer model to combine subword-level representations into word-level ones in the first layers of the encoder, reducing the effective length of the sequences in the following layers and providing a natural point to incorporate extra word-level information. Our experiments show that this approach maintains the translation quality with respect to the normal Transformer model when no extra word-level information is injected and that it is superior to the currently dominant method for incorporating word-level source language information to models based on subword-level vocabularies."

Each hypothesis has its own weight provided by the Ngram-based decoder. This proposed reordering technique offers a better and more efficient translation when compared to both the distance-based and the lexicalized reordering. In addition to this reordering approach, this paper describes a domain adaptation technique which is based on a linear combination of an specific in-domain and an extra out-domain translation models. Results for both approaches are reported in the Arabic-to-English 2008 IWSLT task.

The translation quality analysis is performed under two different domains: journalistic and medical. The systems are evaluated by using standard automatic measures, as well as by native human evaluators. Automatic results show that the statistical system performs better than the rule-based system. Human judgements show that in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction the statistical system also performs better than the rule-based system, while in the Catalan-to-Spanish direction is the other way round. Although the statistical system obtains the best automatic scores, its errors tend to be more penalized by human judgements than the errors of the rule-based system. This can be explained because statistical errors are usually unexpected and they do not follow any pattern."

This algorithm should be able to cope with swapping examples seen during training; it should infer properties that might permit to reorder pairs of blocks (sequences of words) which did not appear during training; and finally it should be robust with respect to training errors and ambiguities.

Coherent improvements are reported in the TC-STAR task (Es/En) at a relatively low computational cost."

The main idea of the statistical machine reordering (SMR) approach is to use the powerful techniques of SMT systems to generate a weighted reordering graph for SMT systems. This technique supplies reordering constraints to an SMT system, using statistical criteria.n n In this paper, we experiment with different graph pruning which guarantees the translation quality improvement due to reordering at a very low increase of computational cost.n n The SMR approach is capable of generalizing reorderings, which have been learned during training, by using word classes instead of words themselves. We experiment with statistical and morphological classes in order to choose those which capture the most probable reorderings.n n Satisfactory results are reported in the WMT07 Es/En task. Our system outperforms in terms of BLEU the WMT07 Official baseline system."

Additionally, we combine both systems, showing accuracy improvements."

It is proposed to project the bilingual tuples onto a continuous space and to estimate the translation probabilities in this representation. A neural network is used to perform the projection and the probability estimation. Smoothing probabilities is most important for tasks with a limited amount of training material. We consider here the BTEC task of the 2006 IWSLT evaluation. Improvements in all official automatic measures are reported when translating from Italian to English. Using a continuous space model for the translation model and the target language model, an improvement of 1.5 BLEU on the test data is observed."

This paper presents a novel strategy for dealing with it: statistical machine reordering (SMR). It consists in using the powerful techniques developed for statistical machine translation (SMT) to translate the source language (S) into a reordered source language (S'), which allows for an improved translation into the target language (T). The SMT task changes from S2T to S'2T which leads to a monotonized word alignment and shorter translation units. In addition, the use of classes in SMR helps to infer new word reorderings. Experiments are reported in the EsEn WMT06 tasks and the ZhEn IWSLT05 task and show significant improvement in translation quality."

In this work, we propose to use a new statistical language model that is based on a continuous representation of the words in the vocabulary.

This kind of approach is in particular promising for tasks where a very limited amount of resources are available, like the BTEC corpus of tourism related questions. This language model is used in two state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems that were developed by UPC for the 2006 IWSLT evaluation campaign: a phraseand an n-gram-based approach. An experimental evaluation for four different language pairs is provided (translation of Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic and Italian to English). The proposed method achieved improvements in the BLEU score of up to 3 points on the development data and of almost 2 points on the official test data."
