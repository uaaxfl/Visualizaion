However, despite their similar functionality these services often differ in the protocols they use, thus complicating the development of clients accessing them. A survey of currently available NLPaaS services suggests that it may be possible to identify a minimal application layer protocol that can be shared by NLPaaS services without sacrificing functionality or convenience, while at the same time simplifying the development of clients for these services. In this paper, we hope to raise awareness of the interoperability problems caused by the variety of existing web service protocols, and describe an effort to identify a set of best practices for NLPaaS protocol design. To that end, we survey and compare protocols used by NLPaaS services and suggest how these protocols may be further aligned to reduce variation."

We introduce a new biomedical event extraction resource consisting of analyses automatically created by systems participating in the recent BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2011. In providing for the first time the outputs of a broad set of state-of-the-art event extraction systems, this resource opens many new opportunities for studying aspects of event extraction, from the identification of common errors to the study of effective approaches to combining the strengths of systems. We demonstrate these opportunities through a multi-system analysis on three BioNLP ST 2011 main tasks, focusing on events that none of the systems can successfully extract. We further argue for new perspectives to the performance evaluation of domain event extraction systems, considering a document-level, off-the-page representation and evaluation to complement the mention-level evaluations pursued in most recent work."

Several corpora containing annotation for these entities have been introduced, GENIA (Kim et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008) and GENETAG (Tanabe et al., 2005) being the most prominent and widely applied. While both aim to address protein/gene annotation, their annotation principles differ notably. One key difference is that GENETAG annotates the conceptual entity, gene, which is often associated with a function, while GENIA concentrates on the physical forms of gene, i.e. protein, DNA and RNA. The difference has caused serious problems relating to the compatibility and comparability of the annotations. In this work, we present an extension of GENIA annotation which integrates GENETAG-style gene annotation. The new version of the GENIA corpus is the first to bring together these two types of entity annotation."

The extraction of linguistically-oriented semactics is more straghtforward, and has been studied independentely of specific domains. In order to find a use of the domain-independent research achievements for TM, we aim at linking classes of the two types of semantics. The classes were connected by analyzing linguistically-oriented semantics of the expressions that mention one biological class. With the obtained relationship between the classes, we discuss a link between TM and linguistically-oriented semantics."

Despite the fact that increasingly complex linguistic information is being added to biomedical texts, no standard solutions have so far been proposed for their encoding. This paper describes a standardised XML tagset (DTD) for annotated biomedical corpora and other resources, which is based on the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines P4, a general and parameterisable standard for encoding language resources. We ground the discussion in the encoding of the GENIA corpus, which currently contains 2,000 abstracts taken from the MEDLINE database, and has almost 100,000 hand-annotated terms marked for semantic class from the accompanying ontology. The paper introduces GENIA and TEI and implements a TEI parametrisation and conversion for the GENIA corpus. A number of aspects of biomedical language are discussed, such as complex tokenisation, prevalence of contractions and complex terms, and the linkage and encoding of ontologies."
